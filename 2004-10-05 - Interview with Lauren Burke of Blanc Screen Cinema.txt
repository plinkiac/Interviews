SSV:
If you had to pick a favorite Blanc Screen movie, which one would it be?

LAUREN:
PERVERT GOES HOME, hands down.
It was the first BSC film I ever had the pleasure of watching and it was also my introduction to the sick and twisted mind of Jay Bauman.
I thought it was amazing and quite a directorial feat coming from someone who had once suffered through the UWM film department.

SSV:
Is there a particular character that you've played who you feel is closest to your true self?

LAUREN:
I think all the characters are like me in some way or another.
But none of them really reflect my personality exactly.
I do wish sometimes that I could be more like Bingo.
She's kind of my hero in a weird way.
There's just something so sweet and innocent about her, and I love her shitty taste in movies.

SSV:
How did you meet director Jay Bauman and get involved with Blanc Screen Cinema?

LAUREN:
Jay and I met through a mutual friend.
At the time Jay was writing CLOWNS AND SUICIDE and was looking for some fresh faces for a couple of roles.
Our mutual friend had seen me in a production of the Vagina Monologues and recommended me to Jay.
The day we met we ended up going to a screening of JASON X.
It was the perfect introduction to Jay's personality.
I've been with BSC and Jay has been my best friend ever since.

SSV:
So what's the deal with that Gilchrist kid?
Sorry, had to ask...

LAUREN:
Iyiyi...I wish I could tell you what his deal is.
This is an unanswerable question.
He's one human being I don't think the world will ever understand.
I've never met anyone so un-selfaware in my entire life.
There will never be any reasoning with him so we all need to just turn around and walk away.

SSV:
Are there any upcoming movies from the Blanc Screen crew with you in them?

LAUREN:
Jay's working on a humdinger of a script right now.
I'll be popping up a number of times in that one as some very odd characters which Jay and I have co-created.
The co-creating happens mostly when we're drunk so naturally it should be interesting.
Until that happens, we're still working on Monkey Make Movie which will retire after episode 10.
A Bingo movie will also happen eventually which I am very excited about.

SSV:
Do you do any acting for others?
If so, how can they contact you?

LAUREN:
I've done a number of student and amateur films and would always love to do more.
Email is always the best way to contact me, or a carrier pigeon...whichever you think is faster.

SSV:
What do you like to do as a person outside of acting?
Do you like Type O Negative?

LAUREN:
When I'm not consumed with all the acting work I get (yea right), I work in television.
I'm currently co-producing a local history of Milwaukee doc for MPTV and running sound on a PBS doc to be aired nationally.
I also act as the outreach coordinator for that project.
Then there's the occasional commercial work when it rolls into town, and I'm part of a team of producers who are working on a TV show in the very early stages of production.
So yeah...I don't do much.
I don't believe I'd had the pleasure of rocking out to the tunes of Type O Negative.
Are they good?

SSV:
Do you feel that the indie film genre is progressing or regressing as a whole?

LAUREN:
I like to think it is progressing but in that progression there seems to be a great possibility for regression.
(?) What I mean is that what I've always loved about indie film is the audience it plays to.
It's been die hard film fans who can find beauty and a masterpiece in a $2,000 shot on VHS, edited with a kitchen knife and scotch tape kind of movie.
Now, indie film seems to be becoming more and more professional looking thanks to the wonderful world of digital thus achieving much more main stream audiences.
But that's not to say that a lot of the more technologically advanced indies haven't been good...I've enjoyed a lot of them.
It's only that Indie films are now the "cool" movies to watch and although I suppose this is great for the filmmaker's wallet and for the genre...it's just not that great for the type of films that are being made.
As Jay once poignantly stated, "support the independents...fuck blockbuster."

SSV:
What is the coolest DVD you've seen in the last three months and why?

LAUREN:
I rented a documentary called SOUTHERN COMFORT a few weeks ago.
The film is about a transsexual named Robert who is dying of cancer and the group of friends who support him, all of whom also happen to be transsexuals.
The characters are wonderfully painted in this documentary and the emotion even carries over into the extras.
There's great unedited footage of the characters discussing Robert after his death and how the release and promotion of the film has changed their lives.
It's what reality television should be.

SSV:
What are your opinions on the legalization of marijuana?

LAUREN:
I'm all for it, and I can't understand why it isn't legal yet.
It seems silly to me.
I can think of a thousand things more dangerous and life threatening than weed.
Pot and prostitution...they should be both legal so we can all be happy.
