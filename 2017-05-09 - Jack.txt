TODD:
Bad movies beware, because, wherever you are, these people will find you and, uh, it’s, it’s gonna happen regardless.
Uh, and I’m here with one of those guys now.
Uh, of course I’m talking about RedLetterMedia.
More specifically, the show Best of the Worst.
And I’m here with one of the gang right now.
He also hosts, co-hosts Previously Recorded with Rich Evans, talking about all the latest video games going on.
Jack Packard.
Hello, Jack.

JACK:
Wooh!

TODD:
You are here, and ready to roll.

JACK:
I am here.

TODD:
I’m glad, I’m glad.
Coming to us from Milwaukee.
Let me ask you, why Milwaukee?
Where, where, why was that the place to set up RLM?

JACK:
I don’t, that, eh, that’s not my call.
This is where I lived, I al - I grew up in, uh, um, in, kind of in between Milwuakee and Chicago.

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
In farm, in farm country in Wisconsin.

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
Very famously grew up on a farm.
And I moved to Milwuakee as I got older, as I got out of the farm, and this is just where I’ve been living.
And then all of a sudden, these jackasses from Chicago come up here...

JACK:
Mike and Jay and Rich.

TODD: 
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
They think they run the joint.

TODD:
Yeah, right?
That, there...

JACK:
Uh, well, no, I think this is just where, uh, this is just where they ended up.
Uh, for awhile they were doing, you know, kind of, uh, for-hire videography work.
And I, I just, uh, I met them here in Milwuakee because we all make videos.

TODD:
Right.
How long you been with them now?

JACK:
Oh, lord.
Like, I’m still not technically with them.
It’s actually a very strange, we have a very weird business relationship.
Like, I am not an employee of RedLetterMedia.

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK: 
I just hang around and they put me in videos.
Um...

TODD:
You just walk in and say:
"Hey, you want to be in this week’s Best of the Worst?"
You’re like:
"Okay, sure."

JACK: 
Pretty much.

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
Pretty much.
And so, like, you know, but we’ve been making videos together, together, like, oh lord, when, I’m trying to remember my first video with them.
I’m trying to remember when The Grabowskis...
I’m gonna look it up right now.

TODD:
Oh, lord.
That’s, like, seven years ago.

JACK:
Do you remember The Grabowskis?

TODD:
I do remember The Grabowskis.

JACK:
Yeah, so maybe, uh, I’ve been with them for about, I’ve, I've been making videos with them for about seven years now.

TODD:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And, it, it just so happened, like I said, we met through mutual friends, and I made videos, and they made videos, and, as someone who makes videos, it’s always really hard to find someone to be in front of the camera.

TODD:
Right, right.

JACK:
And, uh, you know, we just, we got along immediately, and we had a very similar sense of human and, and, and, now they just, now they just keep me around because I’m usually available.

TODD:
You, they put up the food, you feed, you eat it, and then you just keep hanging around.

JACK:
Wait, do other people get food?

TODD: 
They do.
Yeah.
Josh, especially, and I think Rich does.
But, uh, but that's just, that’s just, you know, favoritism out of the whole deal, you know.

JACK:
I think so.
Like, I, I have a deal where I can, uh, I, I steal Mike’s energy drinks all the time.
Uh, and every once in a while I’ll, I’ll take a beer or two out of the fridge.

TODD:
Okay, I’m...

JACK:
But that’s, that’s about it.

TODD:
That’s shocking that Mike has energy drinks, because all I see him drinking is alcohol, so, uh, he, he seems like he wants to dumb down his senses, not raise them at all.

JACK:
You have to, you know, you have to balance.
Like, one energy drink, two beers.
One energy drink, two beers.

TODD:
That, that makes sense, that makes sense.
Uh, how dod you and, uh, Rich come up with Pre Rec.
What, what brought that on?

JACK:
Uh, well, that started after Best of the Worst, um, and, you know, I, Rich, was the person who I met last.
I, I think I met Jay first.
And then, you know, after Jay I met Mike, and started hanging out with them, and Rich at the time still lived in Chicago.
And, so he would have to drive up for shoots every once in a while.
And then when Best of the Worst started, he had finally moved up, and, uh, really, what would happen is, in between watching movies, Rich and I would, in, in trying to bring up nerd conversations to the whole group, say:
"Hey, did you guys hear about that video game?"
And Mike and Jay would immediately, their eyes would glaze over...

TODD:
Glaze over.

JACK:
And Rich would be like:
"Oh, yes, I know of the video games."
And I’d say:
"Ooh, great."
"Comic books?" 

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
And Rich said:
"Yes, I know comic books."

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
Uh, and, we just, we, we, uh, we got along because we were the nerdiest of the group.

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
And, uh, I know Rich had tried with, uh, with his old video game show, Game Station 2.0.
Uh, the only problem was, Rich doesn’t know how to edit.
And so Rich wrote the script, and then either Mike or Jay had to edit it.

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
And they don’t care about video games, so...

TODD:
Exactly.
I, I, I think I remember one time, you were talking about on that show, they had edited, and they didn't, they didn't, they wouldn’t put in the parts that Rich was talking about.
They would just put in random scenes from the video games.
Is that right?

JACK:
Right, right.
Because they, because they didn’t care, and they didn’t care to go through hours of footage.

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
And so, like, it was, it was for Rich’s Vanquish review, and he was talking about how satisfying the shotgun felt.

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
And then they didn’t use footage of him using the shotgun in Vanquish.
It was:
"C'mon, guys!"
"This is Basic 101."

TODD:
101.
You’d think somebody in editing would realize:
"Someone mentions a shotgun."
"I should find a shotgun to put in this scene."
"This might work!"

JACK:
Well, and that’s just how little Mike and Jay cared about video games in general.

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
And, uh, and so, you know, there, there always looking for stuff to supplement their videos, because it takes a long time to edit a Best of the Worst.

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
And sometimes, no movies are coming out for Half in the Bag, and they just don’t feel like making anything.
And so, Previously Recorded was a chance for video content to be made completely outside of Mike and Jay.

TODD:
Mm.

JACK:
Uh, because, I can edit, and I can shoot, and Rich and I can do all the work on that end, and, uh, un-, unfortunately when we started the show, I only had two cameras at the time, which is why all the early episodes only have the back and forth cameras.

TODD:
Right, right.

JACK:
Because I wanted it to be completely separate from, um, Mike and Jay.

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
And now we just kind of have our own thing.
We, we’re off in our little corner of, of Red Letter Media.

TODD:
And that’s nice, yeah.
Because I love Mike and Jay, uh, but their arty-farty pretentiousness tends to take it’s toll.
And so I enjoy listening to yours and Rich’s conversations a little bit better, uh, because they just seem to be more, they’re more up my alley.
They’re more entertaining.

JACK:
Oh, hey, listen, we’re not trying to offend any arty-farty people.

TODD:
No.
No, no, no no.

JACK:
I love arty farty.

TODD:
That’s right.
Love.
And I love Mike and, and, Mike and Jay, but, uh, holy cannoli, sometimes, just sometimes, especially Jay.
I , I , I , I...
Nah.
I mean, like, I love Jay.
I love Jay.
It’s just, there are times when I’m like:
"I have no idea where you’re going with that."
"What does that even mean?"
"I don’t understand you sometimes."

JACK:
Yeah.

TODD:
But it’s, it’s...

JACK:
Sure.
They’re old film school people, you know.

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
And I, I never got into film school, uh, so I just started making videos of my own, but, you know, they’re the type of people that can, that can talk about, you know, the, the different editing techniques and styles.
And they go deep into:
"Oh, this is the uh, the, the coolest shop effects, ooh!"
"We're referencing Chekhov's gun!"

TODD:
Yeah, I, I, I’ve almost turned it into a drinking game, uh, where on Best of the Worst and Half in the Bag:
"When will Mike bring up Star Trek?"
At some point it will happen.
"When will he bring up Star Trek?"
And he always does.
It never fails.

JACK:
Both Mike and Rich are terrible.
And you know, Star Trek’s a great series, but...

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
It, it shouldn’t be your point of reference for ever single piece of media.

TODD:
It, it all doesn’t go back to Star Trek.

JACK:
Exacly.

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
Exactly.

TODD:
So, have you always been a big gamer?

JACK:
Mh-hmm.

TODD:
Yeah?

JACK:
Oh yeah, yeah.
I mean, uh, yes?
I’m trying to, you know, like, I, I’m about to give my cred, uh...

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
I, I have, I have children.
I have two children.

TODD:
Mm.

JACK:
And so when, when my two children were very young, gaming took a huge dive...

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
Because there’s just no time.
Uh, but then I started getting back into it, uh, right around Team Fortress 2 era.

TODD:
Mm.

JACK:
So, you know, like, obviously I played as a kid.
I love, I had an N64...

TODD:
Oh, yeah.

JACK:
And all that.
I, we even had a, was it a Sega Saturn?
That was our big one.

TODD:
Oh, lord.
Really?

JACK:
Yeah, it was a bad choice.

TODD:
Mm!

JACK:
But I was a kid, and, and my mom found it on sale, or something.

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
So we had a Sega Saturn.
We loved the hell out of that.

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
Had all the nintendos, uh...

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
In, in college, uh, you know, the big, the big drinking game was always Mario Kart.

TODD:
Yeah, yeah.

JACK:
Before you could drive home, to make sure you were sober, you had to play Mario Kart to prove to us that you were sober.

TODD:
That is brilliant.

JACK:
Uh...right?

TODD:
That is brilliant.

JACK:
I, I mean, if you didn’t, if you didn’t perform well enough, uh, then you could, you had to sleep on the couch.

TODD:
Oh.

JACK:
But so, then when the, uh, the Xbox 360-era came back around and, you know, the Orange Box gets released, and we get, we get all the, the Half-Life's and Team Fortress 2, and just, uh, the swell of, uh, indie games...

TODD:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Was really fantastic.
And then, as PC game, I’m, I’m a Mac user, and so I wasn’t able to take part in a lot of PC gaming.

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
But as Steam came to Mac, more games came to Mac, I got to play a little bit more, and now I play all the time, which is great.

TODD:
Right.
Because Mac is the bomb.
And I have a Mac, too, and, I, I , I never regretted making that, uh, making that switch.
For sure.
Um, okay, so, we were talking about Best of the Worst.
Uh, how did it get started?
What, what, what convinced everybody that that was, uh, the show to do?

JACK:
Uh, I, part of it, part of it is, I don’t know.
Uh, because I actually, I wasn’t there for the first episode that they filmed.

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
Uh, and, uh, here’s what I can tell you.
Before Best of the Worst, we would get together all the time and just have bad movie nights.

TODD:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Whether it’d be at someone’s house, or at the studio, and we had a great time, every time.
And when you’re content creators, you’re always looking for the next thing to make.
And eventually, we said:
"Hey, maybe we’re good enough to film this."

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
And, like I said, I wasn’t there that first episode, so I, I don’t know whose idea it was, uh, to get Best of the Worst started.

TODD:
RIght.

JACK:
Or who came up with the format.
Or, like, why is it three videos?
Or why did they all have to have a common thread?
It’s, it’s all, it’s all a mystery to me.
I just show up and try to make fun of bad movies.

TODD:
Right.
Does it get, like, almost exhausting trying to make that show?

JACK:
I...

TODD:
Because I feel, like, at times...

JACK:
It’s not almost exhausting.
It is exhausting.
Because, you know, we, we don’t watch the movies beforehand.

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
You know, like, uh, a lot of people will compare us to something like Mystery Science Theater.

TODD:
Oh, yeah, yeah.

JACK:
And, and with Mystery Science Theater, they’re actually kind of watching a movie, and taking notes, and writing a script...

TODD:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And refining the script, and then they shoot the script.
For us, it’s all improv.
It’s, it's whatever we can come up with while we watch it.
And it’s three movies.
And if, you know, if, uh, if three movies are two hours long each, that’s six hours.
And then we talk for another hour-and-a-half.
And that’s seven-and-a-half hours.

TODD:
God...

JACK:
And that’s, uh, it’s an entire day, and it’s exhausting.
And now that we’re on episode...

TODD:
50-something.

JACK:
50?
We’re getting close to 50.

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
It, the real hard part is coming up with new shit to talk about.

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
And, like, how many times can you point out that the boom has dropped into the shot, or how many times can you, can you make fun of, uh, of, uh, Cameron Mitchell.
Hopefully, hopefully we’re never run out of Cameron Mitchell.
