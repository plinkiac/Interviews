CRAIG:
Welcome to Killscreen Cinema.
I am Craig Williams.
So this is a special episode.
I, uh, got the opportunity to sit down and chat with, uh, Jack Packard and Rich Evans from Red Letter Media.
Uh, they also, they host their own video game review show on YouTube called Previously Recorded.
So I had a chance to talk to the two of them about video games, about, uh, bad movies, about movies based on video games, and just a great variety of stuff.
And, uh, of course, we, you know, talked a little about Red Letter Media and how that got started, and how that, how they, you know, rose into prominence on, uh, YouTube.
And it was a great conversation.
We had a lot of fun.
Uh, I, I might've been a little flustered to talk to them, as I had to do this solo.
Uh, Kent and Lauren, unfortunately, couldn't be part of the interview because, uh, they were dealing with, uh, you know, just personal matters.
Uh, as anyone who listens regularly might know, uh, they're, uh, house had burned down.
So they're still wrapping that up.
Everything's working out fine.
But they still have that, you know, they're still dealing with that stuff, and getting that together.
Uh, so they couldn't be part of the interview.
But hopefully, uh, we'll be all together again for the, you know, next episode of Killscreen, uh, where we'll go back to the normal format of, uh, watching a movie and, uh, talking about it.
Uh, but, yeah.
For this, I just was, uh, I was just interested...
I'm a fan or Red Letter Media.
I'm a fan of Previously Recorded.
So, uh, I just was interested in the opportunity to talk to these guys about this stuff, and just hear their opinions and, um, it was a really fun conversation.
And I hope, uh, you guys enjoy it.
So without further ado, Jack Packard and Rich Evans.
So, uh, just to give a little background to our listeners, um, how did each of you get involved with, uh, Red Letter Media?

RICH:
I, I just went to high school with Mike.

CRAIG:
Well, that's, that's one way.

JACK:
You know, sometimes it's about the people you know, you know?

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
I mean, we've been, we've been, we've been making, you know, goofy videos since we were high school kids, I guess.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
It's always been our, our hobby.

CRAIG:
Right.
What made you guys, like, uh, I guess, decide to, like, um, just to, like, make it into a thing, like a studio?
Like a normal...
Like a regular job?

RICH:
Slow evolution?

CRAIG:
Oh.
Okay.

RICH:
Really.
That's what it was.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
We, we made shitty videos in high school.
We made slightly less shitty videos in college.
And, you know, YouTube became a thing.
And, you know...

JACK:
And it's, it's, it's just, you know, one day, you just kind of realize, like,
"Maybe I could just make videos?"
You know, like, that revelation of, uh, understanding like,
"I could do this for work."
It, it's, it's a frightening, frightening prospect.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
We...
I, um, I have, uh...
I'm part of a production group here in Louisville, and we just, we just did a, um, like, the first season of a web series called Bag and Board.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
And, um, it, it's a, it's a great show, but, like, it's, it's, like, we're, now we're at that point, we're like,
"How do we get people to watch it?"
It's, like, that's the tricky, that's the tricky part.

RICH:
That's, that's the tricky part.
That's the, the magic.
That's the...
You have no control over that.

CRAIG:
No, not at all.
Like, I, I tell people all the time, like, making the actual thing is the easy part.
Getting anyone to give a shit, that's the hard part.
That's the damn near impossible part.

JACK:
Absolutely.
One of the, uh...
There was, there was so many, you know, like...
Outside of Red Letter Media, inside of Red Letter Media, there was just so many, so many videos that you just, you throw up there.
Like spaghetti, hoping some will stick.

CRAIG:
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I  guess, like, um, the, uh, was, was it the, uh, the, the Phantom Menace review that got you guys in the spotlight?
Or were you already sort of...

RICH:
No.
That's what got us in the spotlight.
Um, one day, one day, years ago now, uh, Mike, uh, sent me a link to a video he made.
I was, you know, I had no idea he was even doing it.
He was doing, uh, a review of Star Trek Generations.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
As, as, as Plinkett.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
And, uh, he didn't think much of it.
To him, it was just something, you know, he was working on it.
He, he didn't like Star Trek Generations.
And he wanted, he wanted to articulate himself.
And then I watched it.
Because I didn't, I didn't have a hand in that.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I, like, I was like,
"This is, this is genuinely good."
"Like, Mike, this could go somewhere."
"You have to keep making these."

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
And, uh, there was, like, a slow buildup.
He did, like, the, The Next Gen movies, even though the first one had, like, a few hundred views.
And then we got 700 views.
A thousand.
"Ooh!"
"Ooh!"

JACK:
"Holy cow."
"A thousand views?"

RICH:
A few thousand.
And, and then the, we did the Star Wars because it had Star Wars on it.
Suddenly we got, like, you know, a million views.

CRAIG:
Oh, man.
That's awesome.

JACK:
That got the, that got the attention of some, some bigger-named people.

RICH:
Yeah.
It did.
It did.
He got noticed by someone, and tweeted it out, and,
"Here you go, you're viral."

JACK:
And then the, the rest is history.

CRAIG:
I think, I think, I think the reason that went viral is it was, uh, it was an important catharsis that people needed.

JACK:
Absolutely.
Right place.
Right time.
We were...
It had been enough time, the grieving period was over, and we were ready to start being angry at the prequels.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
And, luckily, Mike was there to give us an outlet.

RICH:
The hero we need.

JACK:
He was the hero we deserve.

CRAIG:
Well, I, like, remember the first time I w-, the first time I watched, uh, one of those videos was, was the Generations one.
The Star Trek one.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
And the, uh, the scene with the Kurlan naiskos...
That made me laugh until I was crying.
Like, I was crying laughing at the, just, like, the shattered vase.

RICH:
It's a great...
For one, it's a great sound effect.

CRAIG:
Oh, yes.

RICH:
It's an amazing sound effect.

JACK:
It's...
No, it's a horrible sound effect, because you start hearing it in everything.
It's in every TV show.
It's in every movie.
And I hate, I hate that Mike exaggerated it so much because now I just hear it everywhere I go.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Me, too.
I think they, I think they did that gag in the new, uh, uh, wh-, uh, Wet Hot American Summer show.
Like, I, I could've sworn they were doing the shattering sound, the jar shattering sound effect gag in, like, every episode.

JACK:
Well, that...
Well, that...
I'm, I just, I happened to be a Wet Hot American Summer fanboy.
That, that's actually a callback to the movie.

CRAIG:
Oh, really?

JACK:
They, they do the same thing in the movie where constantly things were, uh, shattering off screen.

CRAIG:
Okay.
I forgot...
It's been a while since I'd seen the, the movie.
So, like, I, I should've watched it right before the series, but I just...
I dunno.
I just got right to the series.

JACK:
That's your fault.

CRAIG:
That is my fault.

JACK:
Rectify this as soon as possible.

CRAIG:
I should've prepared better for this interview by watching Wet Hot American Summer.

JACK:
That's how you prepare for every interview.
I agree.

CRAIG:
Um...

RICH:
I hope you've watched Nell.
Because we just plan on talking about the Jodie Foster film Nell for the next hour and a half.

CRAIG:
Oh, shit.

JACK:
"Nae..."

RICH:
That's our, that's our...
It's all my notes have.

JACK:
"Nae, nae, chickabee."

RICH:
"Nae, nae, chickabee."
"T'ee an me."

CRAIG:
You, you, you couldn't

RICH:
Nobody, nobody is listening knows what the fuck Nell is.
It's just like,
"What, what's that?"

JACK:
I fucking love Nell.

CRAIG:
So what made you guys decide to start, uh, Previously Recorded?

JACK:
Well, you know, I was kind of, uh, as far, as far as RLM is concerned, I'm kind of the new guy.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Of course, you know, I've been hanging out with the guys for, like, five, six years now.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Well, longer than that making other stuff.
And, uh, what would happen is, we'd all get together as a group, either to shoot something or not to shoot something, and just naturally Rich and I, who I didn't even know beforehand.
Rich lived in Chicago...

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
For a long time.
And I lived up here in Milwaukee.
So I, I met Mike and Jay.
And I knew of Rich Evans.
I knew the...

RICH:
The legend.

JACK:
The legend.

CRAIG:
All right.

JACK:
But I, I'd only, like, worked with him a couple times.
Been in the same room with him a couple times.
And, uh, we would just kind of naturally gravitate toward, toward each other.
And, you know, like, I would say to the room,
"Hey!"
"Anybody hear the, the big video game news?
"Huh?"
And, and Jay's eyes would glass over and would leave the room.
And Rich would go,
"Oh, yeah!"
"I heard about that!"
So we would just, like, scoot together naturally.

RICH:
Mike and Jay are not video game guys.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
Moreso Mike, even.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah, he seems damn near grumpy about video games.

RICH:
For the longest time, Mike was, like, you know, he sees me as the video game guy because I know what video games are.
And he's like,
"You should do a video game thing."
Every, every so often this would come up.
"We should do a video game thing."
And then we did Game Station.
It was, it was fucking horrible.

JACK:
Was it three episodes?

RICH:
It was, like, three or four episodes.
And Mike still was like,
"You should do a video game thing."
Even after that failed.
I'm like,
"Mike, I, I can't do this alone."
"I need somebody else."
"Like, ehh, why don't I get Jack?"
"Why not get Jack?"
"We've been talking about video games lately."
"Jack knows what a video game is."
"You like FTL."

JACK:
I played a video game or two.
Yeah, yeah.

CRAIG:
Nice.
Um...

JACK:
And, you know, it was also a show that could be produced because I'm also a video producer.
It's something that can be made outside of Jay and Mike.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Which they...
For them, it's like, 
"I don't need to edit the stupid video game show, and we get more content to put on the site, and that's great."

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
I bet it really...
I bet they like that they get a little bit more time padded out to edit other stuff.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.
Absolutely.

CRAIG:
Sort of a free week.

JACK:
Exactly.
Gives them a little bit of a breather and adds to the, the menagerie.

CRAIG:
Nice.

CRAIG:
So, like, what, uh, what's the criteria, like, for, for games you guys want to cover on the show?

RICH:.
That's a great question.
And I have no idea what it is.

JACK:.
We are still figuring that one out.
We, it, a lot of it is just what we feel like we have something to say about.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:.
You know, No Man's Sky, you know, was our most recent Previously Recorded.
And that one was just a giant E3 showcase for three years in a row.

RICH:.
And so, you know, like, a huge amount of hype.
A lot that we could talk about, even if the game was boring..
There was a lot we could talk about.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:.
We knew we were gonna do that.
Luckily, we had enough we could talk about.
But, like, just recently, we, we decided we wanted to do, uh...
I decided we wanted to do, uh, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Um...
Or, no...

RICH:
That was the new one.

JACK:
That's the new one?

CRAIG:
That's the new one?
Okay.
Yeah.

JACK:
And, and I...

RICH:
I was reluctant because I hadn't played Human Revolution yet.

JACK:
Oh.
And I've never played any of the Deus Ex games.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Neither have I.
I've heard they're good, though.

JACK:
That's what, that's what I hear.
And, uh, they're, they're huge.
They're, that's a big franchise.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And so I, I thought that would be a great show.

RICH:
Moderately.

JACK:
Sure.
Moderately big franchise.
And I started playing it.
And Rich still had reservations.
And I got about 6, 7 hours of play time, and couldn't think of a damn thing to say about it, negative, positive, or otherwise.

RICH:
I, I enjoyed it.
I was enjoying my Deus Ex experience.
The problem is, that's like a, that's like a really long fucking game.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And we don't get, we don't get, you know, pre-release shit.
You know, we, we get the shit after it comes out.

CRAIG:
Uh-huh.

RICH:
By the time, by the time you fully play a game like that, and get a review, and edit the review, the game's been out for two months.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
So, so we ended shelving that, and we're looking at other options now.
It's just whatever we feel like.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Which is, which is nice, and also bad, because we don't have a, a regular release schedule, and I would love a regular release schedule.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
I love scheduling stuff.
It, it...

RICH:
We should, we should start doing more retro things that we're already kind of familar with.
We don't have to worry about playing a 40-hour game.

JACK:
Yes.
Agreed.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I mean, uh, it seem like it's been a while since you guys have done a retro, some sort of retro review.

JACK:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Um, so, what qualities do you guys, like, look for in a game?
That you consider it a good game.

RICH:
Well, that's, that's not, that's not...
There's not one answer to that.

CRAIG:
Sure.
No, no.
Yeah.

RICH:
You gotta, you gotta game like Deus Ex, which Jack was largely indifferent to.
But I, I was enjoying it.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
You know, that's good.
But I also like Tetris.
And there's, like, nothing in common.

CRAIG:
Right.
Yeah.
Every game has, like, you know, of course, like, different appeals, I guess.
Um...

RICH:
It's, it's hard to say there's one way to make a game, and that is good, and...

JACK:
And, and so much depends on your mood.
You know, uh...

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Like, there are, there are some days where...
Like, like, when I was playing Deus Ex, I was also playing that new, um, free-to-play...

RICH:
Dual, or something...

JACK:
Deck-building game, Dualist.
I don't know if you've, if you've heard of this one.

CRAIG:
No.
I haven't.

JACK:
It's, it's called Dualist.
And it's a free-to-play game that's, like, deck-building and, and strategy.
But you a game of Dualist, it takes maybe 5, 10 minutes.
It's just a real quick in-and-out game.
And then, of course, Deus Ex is, is, you're gonna spend six hours and feel like you've accomplished nothing.
But it's an, an incredible experience.
And I, I wasn't in the mood for Deus Ex.
I wasn't in the mood to get immersed into something.
I just wanted five minutes and a simple strategy.

RICH:
Time's, time's a factor, too.
Because, uh, my, you know, my personal...
I've, I've had a lot going on.
Nothing bad.
But just, I've been very busy...

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Lately, in general.
I've been wanting to play the Deus Ex, even though you don't wanna do it anymore.
I wanna play through it.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I wanna, I wanna revisit the Thief series

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
Those are, those are very, you know, like, immersive, kind of long games.
You gotta get into it.
And I just haven't had the time.
Whenever I've been playing a game lately, it's been something like Rocket League, where I can just knock out a couple of matches in 10, 15 minutes that I got free, you know?

JACK:
Exactly.

CRAIG:
Right.
Well, yeah.
You make a good point, Jack, too, about how mood is a factor.
Because I know the, the one thing I can think of.
I remember the first time I ever played, uh, No More Heroes, which I know Rich, it's one of your favorites...

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
One of your favorites.
I, uh, the first time I played it, I hated it.
I just hated it.
And it was, like, you know...
But, but at the time, it was, like, I was, uh, I think if I remember correctly, I was playing it over, over at a friend's house the morning after a party.

RICH:.
Uh-huh.

CRAIG:
So, I, I kind of, I kind of had a hangover.
And I was just killing time.
And I put in No More Heroes, and I'm just, like,
"I can't do this."
"I can't do this right now.".
"This is too much."

JACK:
You probably had a headache, and feeling queasy.
And there's bright flashing lights, and you were done with it.
Absolutely.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
And then there's also just the, the Wii.
Just the Wii controls can be daunting when you're not in the mood.

JACK:
Sure.

CRAIG:
Just like,
"Oh, god.".
"I have to weigh..."

RICH:
I'll, I'll say, I'll say this, though.
No More Heroes is the one game that really uses Wii controls well.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I agree.
And I definitely turned a corner.
I gave the game another chance, and I really enjoyed it.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Uh, and I, I love the second one.
I actually like the second one more.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Is that your feeling, too, Rich?

RICH:
Oh.
I only give about as much.
No, the second one, it's, it's incrementally better, gameplay-wise.
I would argue some of the bosses aren't as interesting.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
But, it's pretty good.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
They, they, they sort of, I felt like the, the, they trimmed the fat, uh, a little bit.
so it's a little bit, uh, stream-, it's more streamlined.
You guys, I feel like in particular, may-, maybe that's just because I, I watch pretty much...
I, I think your show is probably the only YouTube show I watch about video games.
So maybe other YouTubers...

RICH:
Thank you.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I, I really enjoy it.
And I think, uh, I think other YouTubers maybe experienced this, but, uh, what, what do you guys, how do you guys feel about, like, the backlash you'll sometimes get for your opinion on a game?

RICH:
Oh, you just have to ignore it.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
You just ignore it?

RICH:
Well, it, it...
There's always gonna be somebody who doesn't like what you say.

CRAIG:
Sure.

RICH:
Always.

CRAIG:
Sure.

RICH:
You can't, you can't, you can't dwell on it.
You can't get bent out of shape out it, uh, about it.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
You gotta realize there's also a lot of people who like what you're saying, that generally agree with you.
"Yeah, that was a good point."

JACK:
Oh, sure.
I mean, it's, I mean, it is frustrating.
Especially because, you know, we take the time...
We, we have our conversation.
You know, usually when we do one episode of what we talk about for an hour.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And I'll edit it down to 20, 30 minutes or whatnot.
And I try to make our, our, our opinions as concise as possible.
And, you know, like, drive home the points with videos exp-, you know, helping explain.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And so sometimes it does feel that people just don't get what you're saying, and that's super frustrating.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
What's, what's frustrating is when they bring up something that I know we talked about, but just didn't make the edit for whatever reason.

JACK:
Ooh, yeah.

RICH:
And that the most frustrating thing is like,
"Well, we knew."
"We knew."
"I said something."
"Oh..."

JACK:
Sure.
But I had to cut it out because there was a weird noise, or it didn't flow properly.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
That's actually something that's, that's really nice about the livestreams...

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
That we do is, it's a chance to have a back-and-forth with people.
And some-, sometimes it's more productive than other times.
I know with No Man's Sky, there was, there was a couple, there was a couple who were just, just beating on us for hating that, but...

CRAIG:
Oh, um, on...
During the stream?

JACK:
During the stream, yeah.

CRAIG:
Oh, man.

JACK:
But, but, also it gives us an, an opportunity to have a more in-depth conversation about what we think.
And, you know, sometimes the chat will bring up a point, and we'll be able to counter that point and actually have a, some sort of back-and-forth, which is very nice.

RICH:
Excuse me.

JACK:
Rich just stepped on a duck.

CRAIG:
Oh.

JACK:
I don't know how that duck got in here.

CRAIG:
Um, so, uh, something I, I notice in the stream, um, a lot is people will get f-, like, people will get fix-shated, um, on...

RICH:
"Fix-shated?

CRAIG:
Fixated. I'm having trouble saying words. Fixated.

RICH:
You're pulling a Rich Evans.

CRAIG:
You're pulling a Rich Evans.

RICH:
I so rarely get to correct other people.

JACK:
It's contagious.
Oh, god.

CRAIG:
I'm honored to be corrected by you, Rich.
Uh, somebody like to...
They, they get, they seems to, like, um, you know, fixate on, uh, stuff that you guys don't like for whatever reason.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Uh, maybe like genres.
Like, I know, uh, for example, you, Rich, a lot of people, um, in the, in the chat, anyway...

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Are well, well aware that you, you don't like JRPG's.

RICH:
Yes.

CRAIG:
Um...
And so they can't stop...
Sometimes they just can't seem to stop either...

RICH:
They don't, they don't get it.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
They don't get it, yeah.

RICH:
They keep, they keep recommending other ones, because I guess I just haven't played the right one yet.

JACK:
You have to play them all until you find the one that convinces you it's a worthwhile genre.

RICH:
People...
When...
I think, I think when people are fans of you, though, they want you to like the same things that they like.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And, and it's distressing when you don't.

JACK:
Well, you know, like, these people, obviously, you know, they, they, they watch us a lot, and perhaps they agree with us a lot.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
And so they've built up in their head like,
"Oh."
"Every opinion that Jack and Rich have, I'm going to share, because I've shared all of their opinions up to this point."
And then we hit that one where it's, you know,
"Ehh, I'm not super big into anime."

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And it breaks their, this relationship...

RICH:
It drives everyone nuts.

JACK:
Right.
Well, it breaks the mold that they have of us.
"No, you just haven't seen the right one."

CRAIG:
I can relate to that.
I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why I actually your show, and your, uh, stream, is, uh, because your opinions aren't always aligned with mine, and so I find it more interesting to hear a different perspective, I guess, on something that I...
Like, you know, I, I'm a fan of The Last of Us.

JACK:
Oh, no!

RICH:
You are allowed to be.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Exactly.
And so I enjoyed the game, but I actually found it very interesting to watch you play it, Rich...

RICH:
Yeah?

CRAIG:
Because it was interesting to basically, I guess, witness your experience of the game.
Uh, and just why you would, why you would hate it.
Because, like, I, I could sort of symp-...
Even though I liked the game, while you were playing it, I kind of sympathized with you a little bit.
I was like,
"Okay."
"Okay."
"I can see why, I can see why it just is..."

RICH:
That's just...

CRAIG:
Yeah.
"I can see why he's not into this."
You know, I mean, uh, so, I mean, I think that appeals to me.
But I think maybe, maybe people, uh, other people...
Yeah.
Like you, like you said, they, they rely so much on your opinion.
They don't know what to do when it's, like, suddenly, you know, different than theirs...

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Or, uh, also I think a lot of people, especially nowadays, they, they maybe attach too much of their personality to the stuff that they like.
And so when, when you guys, when, when it's trashed by someone, it's, like, an affront to them.
You know?

RICH:
It's, it's the same with politics.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Exactly.

JACK:
Absolutely.
Well, you know, these, uh, pop, these pop culture things, you know, movies, comic books, video games, we, we kind of throw them, them up as flags.
You know, like they did in the old sailing times.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
To help identify ourselves, right?
So, so I throw up the little flag there that says,
"I like Super Mario Bros."
And then other people who see that we have a kinship.
"Hey, we both like Super Mario Bros."

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
"We can be brothers."

RICH:
See, I'm a hermit.
I don't sell flags.
I just want to be left alone in my little boat.

JACK:
Oh...

RICH:
Like, I got a tiny boat.
I'm living off the sea.
Just stay, stay the hell away from me.
I, I don't need to fly my flag out.
No, that's fine.

JACK:
That's sad.

RICH:
No.
That's fine.
I'm just, I'm naturally a hermit.

CRAIG:
No.
I, I, I, I relate to that.

RICH:
I play games specifically not to interact with other people.
When I wanna avoid that, that's when I turn on the game.

JACK:
Yeah, yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I, uh, you, you've talked about how, uh, you hate multiplayer games for that reason.
And I, I was...
When, whenever you would say it, I know, uh, when I would listen to that, I would sort of pump my fist in the air because I'm like,
"Oh, I totally understand what he's saying right now."
Like, I get that.
I totally get that because, like, yeah, I play video games as a way to relax.
Like, not to get...
I don't wanna get worked up and angry.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
And, uh, and, uh, have a, like a negative social experience while I'm playing the game.
Because that's not why I'm playing it, you know?

RICH:
There's always a jerk you run into.

CRAIG:
Oh, absolutely.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
But, but the, there's a flipside to that coin, which is you could have an amazing experience, and work together as a team, and believe in the power of humanity once again.

RICH:
Or I could just turn on DOOM and shoot a bunch of monsters.
That's fun.

CRAIG:
Exactly.
Um, uh...
So to prepare for this interview, I, uh, I finally got around to watching Space Cop.

RICH:
Uh-oh.

CRAIG:
And I wrote a very thorough review that I'm gonna read right now.
No, I'm just kidding.

RICH:
Okay.

CRAIG:
No, I enjoyed it.
I enjoy the, uh...
I enjoyed the movie.
I was, uh, I was very impressed.
Like, um, it, you know, I, I like the special...
I thought the special effects, um, uh, were good.
Like, it's...
I know you guys were going for...

RICH:
You can thank Jim and Colin for a lot of that.

JACK:
Oh, yeah.
The Canadians...

RICH:
The Canadians, man.

JACK:
Are, are magic workers.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Absolutely.
I thought they did really well.
And I like the balance between, um, like, the special effects that they, that they did.
And then just the miniatures.
And, uh...

RICH:
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Like, the, yeah.
The, yeah.
The way you guys try to sort of make it look like sort of a, like a cheesy sort of, uh, sci-fi movie.
Uh, at least I hope that's why, what you guys were doing.

RICH:
Some, sometimes you make a low-budget movie because you have a low budget.

CRAIG:
Oh, okay.

RICH:
You have to embrace that.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
You have to roll with it.
Absolutely.

CRAIG:
Oh, sure.
Um...
But, uh, yeah.
I thought it was good.
And I thought you did really well, too, Rich.
I just wanted to, wanted to say that.

RICH:
Thank you.
Thank you.

CRAIG:
I thought you, uh, played that character, uh, pretty perfectly.
It was an interesting, it's an interesting protagonist.
Uh, uh, a character that doesn't want to save anyone.
He just, just kind of wants to be left alone in his little boat, like you were talking about earlier.

RICH:
You know, I, I recently, like, like, last week I watched Hot Fuzz for the first time.

CRAIG:
Oh, nice.

JACK:
For the first time?

RICH:
And I, I didn't even realize it.
Apparently I was doing a Simon Pegg impression with Space Cop.

JACK:
And you know what?
I didn't put that together.

RICH:
In the last quarter of that movie, when he's just shooting everything, he's got the,
"Yeah."
"I'm a hard-nosed cop."

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I guess so.

JACK:
He was just doing an early Rich Evans impression.

RICH:
Maybe.
Maybe.

JACK:
That's it.

CRAIG:
Um, well, I have to ask, what, what did you think of Hot Fuzz?
Because it's...

RICH:
Hot Fuzz is amazing.

CRAIG:
Oh, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.

RICH:
I, I had it pegged for something different than what it is.
I, I was thinking, like, a Super Troopers.
Like, goofy cops.
Ehh, I wasn't that interested.

JACK:
Oh.

RICH:
Goof-, ehh, it's goofy cops.
I get it.
No, no.
I saw the movie.
It's not that at all.
It's amazing.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It's one of those movie that when I saw it the theater, I liked it.
But I wasn't sure, like...
I, I walked out of the theater, and I was like,
"I think I liked that movie."
"But I don't, I don't know why."
Because...
And then I realized it's because the movie completely, um, like, completely reversed my expectations.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Like, it, it just...
It was, it was not like a typical movie experience.
Um...

RICH:
It's not a, it's not a easy, dumb comedy.
Which they could've made.
But they didn't.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Exactly.
Exactly.

JACK:
I think that, like, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have this amazing talent, like...
If you look at Shawn of the Dead, and you look at Hot Fuzz, and, you know, other movies, but those two in, in particular...

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.
They are movies without the cynicism that usually comes along with satire.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
You can tell that they love zombie movies.
For all their faults and all of their budget, they love zombie movies.
You can tell that they love cheesy action movies.
And that comes through the scenes.

RICH:
Here's, here's the theme with their work.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
They could've made, uh, easily made a genre movie.
"It's, it's a zombie."
"It's a goofy zombie movie."
"We're building a movie around where whacky zombie things happen."
But they don't just do that.
They don't just make a cop action movie.
They start with the characters, nd this whole character story that plays out in character relationships, while the goofy genre stuff is going on almost in the background.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Or alongside.
Parallel.

JACK:
Interwoven.

RICH:
Yeah.
Interwoven.

JACK:
Inter-...
It's, it's, it's beautiful.
And I, I mean, I love those, those kind of, like, Bad Boys.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Bad Boys II.
The Rock.
Any, any early Michael Bay, I fucking love with, with a, with a huge heart.
And they, they nailed it why I loved it so much.

CRAIG:
Well, there's, there's, like, an honesty with those movies.
I think that's why they're so appealing.
Like, The Rock, and, and Bad Boys and all those movies.
I feel like they had, there was a genuine, like, they're just making...
I feel like they were just like,
"We're gonna make a schlocky action movie, and just have fun with it."

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Uh, and it sort of, that sort of translates through what otherwise could be considered a bad movie.
Um, I guess that's the difference between, like, when it comes to, like, bad movies that are fun to watch and bad movies that aren't fun to watch.
It's that, like, bad movie...
Which I'm sure you guys are well-versed in.
Well-versed it.
Um, movies that are fun to watch that are bad are fun because the people who made it, I think, had fun making it.
Like, even though it turned out not the way they wanted...

RICH:
Mm...

JACK:
I don't know about that.
I...
Usually what we find...

RICH:
They're oblivious, I think.

JACK:
Is, is the ego has overtaken their ability to make a good movie.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
I can see that.

JACK:
And they can longer see that it's a bad movie.
That's what makes some of the best, best movies.
There's, there's this wonderful documentary about the making of Miami Connection.
And Miami Connection is a brilliantly bad movie.

CRAIG:
Oh, yes.
One of my favorites.

JACK:
And then the creator is talking about, you know, he had never made a movie before.
"But how hard could it be to make a movie?"
"I mean, I've seen movies before."
And, and he...
It almost bankrupted him making Miami Connection.
But he believed in it so much, and at the end of the day, he saw it and threw it in a dumpster.

RICH:
There, there is this movie at RLM that everyone here is very fond of.
We've never...
I don't think we've ever done anything with it on camera yet, called Partners.

JACK:
Oh!
The greatest movie ever made.

RICH:
It's, it's the best movie ever made.
Um, it's, it's terrible.
It's absolutely terrible.
And, like, after we watched it, we looked up the creator on YouTube.
We watched, like, an interview with him about the film.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
He talks about it like he made The Godfather.
How, how, what an important piece of artistic, uh, uh, work that he, he created.

JACK:
Like, we...

RICH:
And he's just oblivious to how horrible the movie is.
Oblivious.

JACK:
We looked this guy up, this guy who made partners, and, and he was a film teacher.
And he would often cite his film, Partners, as, you know, being quality film, and, and used that to teach other students.
We, we got a hold of this movie, and it's, like, it's...

RICH:
It does everything wrong.

JACK:
It does everything wrong.
They, they, they have a scene in which these guys are supposed to be police officers giving a police briefing.
And it's in the kitchen of a house.

RICH:
And you never see who they're speaking to.
You never see, like, the crowd of police officers.

CRAIG:
Oh, that's funny.

RICH:
And there's this magical corkboard, that even though there's three different people...
The corkboard is behind every one of them in their own shots.

JACK:
Like, this guy cannot frame a shot properly, let alone, like, cut a movie together.

RICH:
And he's teaching!

JACK:
And he's teaching film.

RICH:
He's teaching.

JACK:
Ego is the most important thing.
Ego and, and...

RICH:
Ego and lack of talent to back it up.

JACK:
Yes.
That is what creates the perfect movie.

RICH:
The, the masterpiece.
That's what makes the masterpieces.

CRAIG:
That's what creates the Neil Breen's and the Tommy Wiseau's.

RICH:
Yes.

JACK:
Ooh, yes.

RICH:
Yes.

JACK:
The Room is another fantastic example.

CRAIG:
Are you, are you guys excited, uh, for the, uh, Disaster Artist movie?
Because I, I can't, I can't help but be curious about that.

RICH:
Curious about it.
I don't know that I'm excited about it.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I've read the book.
It's a good book.

CRAIG:
Oh, I love the book.
Yeah, the book is so great.

JACK:
I, I've actually never seen The Room.

CRAIG:
What?
Really?
I thought you did.

JACK:
I know...
We...

RICH:
I certainly have.
Jack's, Jack's speaking for himself.

JACK:
I'm speaking for Jack.
We, we do this Best of the Worst show, where we, where we watch bad movies and talk about them.
And The Room is the possibly most famous bad movie in the past, what, 20 years.
And I just never got around to seeing it.
And then, like, I stopped caring because it, it became this, like, bad movie that everyone has to see.
And I just stopped caring.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
I hear really...
I hear the book is fantastic.

RICH:
Yeah.
It is.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
It's, it's one of those books that, while you're reading it, your jaw will drop many times.
Like, it's just, it's kind of unbelievable.

RICH:
Like his second belt.
If you read the book, you'll know what I'm talking about.
