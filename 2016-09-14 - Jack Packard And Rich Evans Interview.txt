CRAIG:
Welcome to Killscreen Cinema.
I am Craig Williams.
So this is a special episode.
I, uh, got the opportunity to sit down and chat with, uh, Jack Packard and Rich Evans from Red Letter Media.
Uh, they also, they host their own video game review show on YouTube called Previously Recorded.
So I had a chance to talk to the two of them about video games, about, uh, bad movies, about movies based on video games, and just a great variety of stuff.
And, uh, of course, we, you know, talked a little about Red Letter Media and how that got started, and how that, how they, you know, rose into prominence on, uh, YouTube.
And it was a great conversation.
We had a lot of fun.
Uh, I, I might've been a little flustered to talk to them, as I had to do this solo.
Uh, Kent and Lauren, unfortunately, couldn't be part of the interview because, uh, they were dealing with, uh, you know, just personal matters.
Uh, as anyone who listens regularly might know, uh, they're, uh, house had burned down.
So they're still wrapping that up.
Everything's working out fine.
But they still have that, you know, they're still dealing with that stuff, and getting that together.
Uh, so they couldn't be part of the interview.
But hopefully, uh, we'll be all together again for the, you know, next episode of Killscreen, uh, where we'll go back to the normal format of, uh, watching a movie and, uh, talking about it.
Uh, but, yeah.
For this, I just was, uh, I was just interested...
I'm a fan or Red Letter Media.
I'm a fan of Previously Recorded.
So, uh, I just was interested in the opportunity to talk to these guys about this stuff, and just hear their opinions and, um, it was a really fun conversation.
And I hope, uh, you guys enjoy it.
So without further ado, Jack Packard and Rich Evans.
So, uh, just to give a little background to our listeners, um, how did each of you get involved with, uh, Red Letter Media?

RICH:
I, I just went to high school with Mike.

CRAIG:
Well, that's, that's one way.

JACK:
You know, sometimes it's about the people you know, you know?

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
I mean, we've been, we've been, we've been making, you know, goofy videos since we were high school kids, I guess.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
It's always been our, our hobby.

CRAIG:
Right.
What made you guys, like, uh, I guess, decide to, like, um, just to, like, make it into a thing, like a studio?
Like a normal...
Like a regular job?

RICH:
Slow evolution?

CRAIG:
Oh.
Okay.

RICH:
Really.
That's what it was.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
We, we made shitty videos in high school.
We made slightly less shitty videos in college.
And, you know, YouTube became a thing.
And, you know...

JACK:
And it's, it's, it's just, you know, one day, you just kind of realize, like,
"Maybe I could just make videos?"
You know, like, that revelation of, uh, understanding like,
"I could do this for work."
It, it's, it's a frightening, frightening prospect.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
We...
I, um, I have, uh...
I'm part of a production group here in Louisville, and we just, we just did a, um, like, the first season of a web series called Bag and Board.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
And, um, it, it's a, it's a great show, but, like, it's, it's, like, we're, now we're at that point, we're like,
"How do we get people to watch it?"
It's, like, that's the tricky, that's the tricky part.

RICH:
That's, that's the tricky part.
That's the, the magic.
That's the...
You have no control over that.

CRAIG:
No, not at all.
Like, I, I tell people all the time, like, making the actual thing is the easy part.
Getting anyone to give a shit, that's the hard part.
That's the damn near impossible part.

JACK:
Absolutely.
One of the, uh...
There was, there was so many, you know, like...
Outside of Red Letter Media, inside of Red Letter Media, there was just so many, so many videos that you just, you throw up there.
Like spaghetti, hoping some will stick.

CRAIG:
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I  guess, like, um, the, uh, was, was it the, uh, the, the Phantom Menace review that got you guys in the spotlight?
Or were you already sort of...

RICH:
No.
That's what got us in the spotlight.
Um, one day, one day, years ago now, uh, Mike, uh, sent me a link to a video he made.
I was, you know, I had no idea he was even doing it.
He was doing, uh, a review of Star Trek Generations.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
As, as, as Plinkett.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
And, uh, he didn't think much of it.
To him, it was just something, you know, he was working on it.
He, he didn't like Star Trek Generations.
And he wanted, he wanted to articulate himself.
And then I watched it.
Because I didn't, I didn't have a hand in that.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I, like, I was like,
"This is, this is genuinely good."
"Like, Mike, this could go somewhere."
"You have to keep making these."

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
And, uh, there was, like, a slow buildup.
He did, like, the, The Next Gen movies, even though the first one had, like, a few hundred views.
And then we got 700 views.
A thousand.
"Ooh!"
"Ooh!"

JACK:
"Holy cow."
"A thousand views?"

RICH:
A few thousand.
And, and then the, we did the Star Wars because it had Star Wars on it.
Suddenly we got, like, you know, a million views.

CRAIG:
Oh, man.
That's awesome.

JACK:
That got the, that got the attention of some, some bigger-named people.

RICH:
Yeah.
It did.
It did.
He got noticed by someone, and tweeted it out, and,
"Here you go, you're viral."

JACK:
And then the, the rest is history.

CRAIG:
I think, I think, I think the reason that went viral is it was, uh, it was an important catharsis that people needed.

JACK:
Absolutely.
Right place.
Right time.
We were...
It had been enough time, the grieving period was over, and we were ready to start being angry at the prequels.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
And, luckily, Mike was there to give us an outlet.

RICH:
The hero we need.

JACK:
He was the hero we deserve.

CRAIG:
Well, I, like, remember the first time I w-, the first time I watched, uh, one of those videos was, was the Generations one.
The Star Trek one.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
And the, uh, the scene with the Kurlan naiskos...
That made me laugh until I was crying.
Like, I was crying laughing at the, just, like, the shattered vase.

RICH:
It's a great...
For one, it's a great sound effect.

CRAIG:
Oh, yes.

RICH:
It's an amazing sound effect.

JACK:
It's...
No, it's a horrible sound effect, because you start hearing it in everything.
It's in every TV show.
It's in every movie.
And I hate, I hate that Mike exaggerated it so much because now I just hear it everywhere I go.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Me, too.
I think they, I think they did that gag in the new, uh, uh, wh-, uh, Wet Hot American Summer show.
Like, I, I could've sworn they were doing the shattering sound, the jar shattering sound effect gag in, like, every episode.

JACK:
Well, that...
Well, that...
I'm, I just, I happened to be a Wet Hot American Summer fanboy.
That, that's actually a callback to the movie.

CRAIG:
Oh, really?

JACK:
They, they do the same thing in the movie where constantly things were, uh, shattering off screen.

CRAIG:
Okay.
I forgot...
It's been a while since I'd seen the, the movie.
So, like, I, I should've watched it right before the series, but I just...
I dunno.
I just got right to the series.

JACK:
That's your fault.

CRAIG:
That is my fault.

JACK:
Rectify this as soon as possible.

CRAIG:
I should've prepared better for this interview by watching Wet Hot American Summer.

JACK:
That's how you prepare for every interview.
I agree.

CRAIG:
Um...

RICH:
I hope you've watched Nell.
Because we just plan on talking about the Jodie Foster film Nell for the next hour and a half.

CRAIG:
Oh, shit.

JACK:
"Nae..."

RICH:
That's our, that's our...
It's all my notes have.

JACK:
"Nae, nae, chickabee."

RICH:
"Nae, nae, chickabee."
"T'ee an me."

CRAIG:
You, you, you couldn't

RICH:
Nobody, nobody is listening knows what the fuck Nell is.
It's just like,
"What, what's that?"

JACK:
I fucking love Nell.

CRAIG:
So what made you guys decide to start, uh, Previously Recorded?

JACK:
Well, you know, I was kind of, uh, as far, as far as RLM is concerned, I'm kind of the new guy.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Of course, you know, I've been hanging out with the guys for, like, five, six years now.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Well, longer than that making other stuff.
And, uh, what would happen is, we'd all get together as a group, either to shoot something or not to shoot something, and just naturally Rich and I, who I didn't even know beforehand.
Rich lived in Chicago...

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
For a long time.
And I lived up here in Milwaukee.
So I, I met Mike and Jay.
And I knew of Rich Evans.
I knew the...

RICH:
The legend.

JACK:
The legend.

CRAIG:
All right.

JACK:
But I, I'd only, like, worked with him a couple times.
Been in the same room with him a couple times.
And, uh, we would just kind of naturally gravitate toward, toward each other.
And, you know, like, I would say to the room,
"Hey!"
"Anybody hear the, the big video game news?
"Huh?"
And, and Jay's eyes would glass over and would leave the room.
And Rich would go,
"Oh, yeah!"
"I heard about that!"
So we would just, like, scoot together naturally.

RICH:
Mike and Jay are not video game guys.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
Moreso Mike, even.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah, he seems damn near grumpy about video games.

RICH:
For the longest time, Mike was, like, you know, he sees me as the video game guy because I know what video games are.
And he's like,
"You should do a video game thing."
Every, every so often this would come up.
"We should do a video game thing."
And then we did Game Station.
It was, it was fucking horrible.

JACK:
Was it three episodes?

RICH:
It was, like, three or four episodes.
And Mike still was like,
"You should do a video game thing."
Even after that failed.
I'm like,
"Mike, I, I can't do this alone."
"I need somebody else."
"Like, ehh, why don't I get Jack?"
"Why not get Jack?"
"We've been talking about video games lately."
"Jack knows what a video game is."
"You like FTL."

JACK:
I played a video game or two.
Yeah, yeah.

CRAIG:
Nice.
Um...

JACK:
And, you know, it was also a show that could be produced because I'm also a video producer.
It's something that can be made outside of Jay and Mike.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Which they...
For them, it's like, 
"I don't need to edit the stupid video game show, and we get more content to put on the site, and that's great."

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
I bet it really...
I bet they like that they get a little bit more time padded out to edit other stuff.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.
Absolutely.

CRAIG:
Sort of a free week.

JACK:
Exactly.
Gives them a little bit of a breather and adds to the, the menagerie.

CRAIG:
Nice.

CRAIG:
So, like, what, uh, what's the criteria, like, for, for games you guys want to cover on the show?

RICH:.
That's a great question.
And I have no idea what it is.

JACK:.
We are still figuring that one out.
We, it, a lot of it is just what we feel like we have something to say about.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:.
You know, No Man's Sky, you know, was our most recent Previously Recorded.
And that one was just a giant E3 showcase for three years in a row.

RICH:.
And so, you know, like, a huge amount of hype.
A lot that we could talk about, even if the game was boring..
There was a lot we could talk about.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:.
We knew we were gonna do that.
Luckily, we had enough we could talk about.
But, like, just recently, we, we decided we wanted to do, uh...
I decided we wanted to do, uh, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Um...
Or, no...

RICH:
That was the new one.

JACK:
That's the new one?

CRAIG:
That's the new one?
Okay.
Yeah.

JACK:
And, and I...

RICH:
I was reluctant because I hadn't played Human Revolution yet.

JACK:
Oh.
And I've never played any of the Deus Ex games.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Neither have I.
I've heard they're good, though.

JACK:
That's what, that's what I hear.
And, uh, they're, they're huge.
They're, that's a big franchise.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And so I, I thought that would be a great show.

RICH:
Moderately.

JACK:
Sure.
Moderately big franchise.
And I started playing it.
And Rich still had reservations.
And I got about 6, 7 hours of play time, and couldn't think of a damn thing to say about it, negative, positive, or otherwise.

RICH:
I, I enjoyed it.
I was enjoying my Deus Ex experience.
The problem is, that's like a, that's like a really long fucking game.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And we don't get, we don't get, you know, pre-release shit.
You know, we, we get the shit after it comes out.

CRAIG:
Uh-huh.

RICH:
By the time, by the time you fully play a game like that, and get a review, and edit the review, the game's been out for two months.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
So, so we ended shelving that, and we're looking at other options now.
It's just whatever we feel like.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Which is, which is nice, and also bad, because we don't have a, a regular release schedule, and I would love a regular release schedule.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
I love scheduling stuff.
It, it...

RICH:
We should, we should start doing more retro things that we're already kind of familar with.
We don't have to worry about playing a 40-hour game.

JACK:
Yes.
Agreed.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I mean, uh, it seem like it's been a while since you guys have done a retro, some sort of retro review.

JACK:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Um, so, what qualities do you guys, like, look for in a game?
That you consider it a good game.

RICH:
Well, that's, that's not, that's not...
There's not one answer to that.

CRAIG:
Sure.
No, no.
Yeah.

RICH:
You gotta, you gotta game like Deus Ex, which Jack was largely indifferent to.
But I, I was enjoying it.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
You know, that's good.
But I also like Tetris.
And there's, like, nothing in common.

CRAIG:
Right.
Yeah.
Every game has, like, you know, of course, like, different appeals, I guess.
Um...

RICH:
It's, it's hard to say there's one way to make a game, and that is good, and...

JACK:
And, and so much depends on your mood.
You know, uh...

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Like, there are, there are some days where...
Like, like, when I was playing Deus Ex, I was also playing that new, um, free-to-play...

RICH:
Dual, or something...

JACK:
Deck-building game, Dualist.
I don't know if you've, if you've heard of this one.

CRAIG:
No.
I haven't.

JACK:
It's, it's called Dualist.
And it's a free-to-play game that's, like, deck-building and, and strategy.
But you a game of Dualist, it takes maybe 5, 10 minutes.
It's just a real quick in-and-out game.
And then, of course, Deus Ex is, is, you're gonna spend six hours and feel like you've accomplished nothing.
But it's an, an incredible experience.
And I, I wasn't in the mood for Deus Ex.
I wasn't in the mood to get immersed into something.
I just wanted five minutes and a simple strategy.

RICH:
Time's, time's a factor, too.
Because, uh, my, you know, my personal...
I've, I've had a lot going on.
Nothing bad.
But just, I've been very busy...

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Lately, in general.
I've been wanting to play the Deus Ex, even though you don't wanna do it anymore.
I wanna play through it.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I wanna, I wanna revisit the Thief series

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
Those are, those are very, you know, like, immersive, kind of long games.
You gotta get into it.
And I just haven't had the time.
Whenever I've been playing a game lately, it's been something like Rocket League, where I can just knock out a couple of matches in 10, 15 minutes that I got free, you know?

JACK:
Exactly.

CRAIG:
Right.
Well, yeah.
You make a good point, Jack, too, about how mood is a factor.
Because I know the, the one thing I can think of.
I remember the first time I ever played, uh, No More Heroes, which I know Rich, it's one of your favorites...

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
One of your favorites.
I, uh, the first time I played it, I hated it.
I just hated it.
And it was, like, you know...
But, but at the time, it was, like, I was, uh, I think if I remember correctly, I was playing it over, over at a friend's house the morning after a party.

RICH:.
Uh-huh.

CRAIG:
So, I, I kind of, I kind of had a hangover.
And I was just killing time.
And I put in No More Heroes, and I'm just, like,
"I can't do this."
"I can't do this right now.".
"This is too much."

JACK:
You probably had a headache, and feeling queasy.
And there's bright flashing lights, and you were done with it.
Absolutely.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
And then there's also just the, the Wii.
Just the Wii controls can be daunting when you're not in the mood.

JACK:
Sure.

CRAIG:
Just like,
"Oh, god.".
"I have to weigh..."

RICH:
I'll, I'll say, I'll say this, though.
No More Heroes is the one game that really uses Wii controls well.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I agree.
And I definitely turned a corner.
I gave the game another chance, and I really enjoyed it.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Uh, and I, I love the second one.
I actually like the second one more.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Is that your feeling, too, Rich?

RICH:
Oh.
I only give about as much.
No, the second one, it's, it's incrementally better, gameplay-wise.
I would argue some of the bosses aren't as interesting.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
But, it's pretty good.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
They, they, they sort of, I felt like the, the, they trimmed the fat, uh, a little bit.
so it's a little bit, uh, stream-, it's more streamlined.
You guys, I feel like in particular, may-, maybe that's just because I, I watch pretty much...
I, I think your show is probably the only YouTube show I watch about video games.
So maybe other YouTubers...

RICH:
Thank you.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I, I really enjoy it.
And I think, uh, I think other YouTubers maybe experienced this, but, uh, what, what do you guys, how do you guys feel about, like, the backlash you'll sometimes get for your opinion on a game?

RICH:
Oh, you just have to ignore it.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
You just ignore it?

RICH:
Well, it, it...
There's always gonna be somebody who doesn't like what you say.

CRAIG:
Sure.

RICH:
Always.

CRAIG:
Sure.

RICH:
You can't, you can't, you can't dwell on it.
You can't get bent out of shape out it, uh, about it.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
You gotta realize there's also a lot of people who like what you're saying, that generally agree with you.
"Yeah, that was a good point."

JACK:
Oh, sure.
I mean, it's, I mean, it is frustrating.
Especially because, you know, we take the time...
We, we have our conversation.
You know, usually when we do one episode of what we talk about for an hour.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And I'll edit it down to 20, 30 minutes or whatnot.
And I try to make our, our, our opinions as concise as possible.
And, you know, like, drive home the points with videos exp-, you know, helping explain.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And so sometimes it does feel that people just don't get what you're saying, and that's super frustrating.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
What's, what's frustrating is when they bring up something that I know we talked about, but just didn't make the edit for whatever reason.

JACK:
Ooh, yeah.

RICH:
And that the most frustrating thing is like,
"Well, we knew."
"We knew."
"I said something."
"Oh..."

JACK:
Sure.
But I had to cut it out because there was a weird noise, or it didn't flow properly.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
That's actually something that's, that's really nice about the livestreams...

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
That we do is, it's a chance to have a back-and-forth with people.
And some-, sometimes it's more productive than other times.
I know with No Man's Sky, there was, there was a couple, there was a couple who were just, just beating on us for hating that, but...

CRAIG:
Oh, um, on...
During the stream?

JACK:
During the stream, yeah.

CRAIG:
Oh, man.

JACK:
But, but, also it gives us an, an opportunity to have a more in-depth conversation about what we think.
And, you know, sometimes the chat will bring up a point, and we'll be able to counter that point and actually have a, some sort of back-and-forth, which is very nice.

RICH:
Excuse me.

JACK:
Rich just stepped on a duck.

CRAIG:
Oh.
