CRAIG:
Welcome to Killscreen Cinema.
I am Craig Williams.
So this is a special episode.
I, uh, got the opportunity to sit down and chat with, uh, Jack Packard and Rich Evans from Red Letter Media.
Uh, they also, they host their own video game review show on YouTube called Previously Recorded.
So I had a chance to talk to the two of them about video games, about, uh, bad movies, about movies based on video games, and just a great variety of stuff.
And, uh, of course, we, you know, talked a little about Red Letter Media and how that got started, and how that, how they, you know, rose into prominence on, uh, YouTube.
And it was a great conversation.
We had a lot of fun.
Uh, I, I might've been a little flustered to talk to them, as I had to do this solo.
Uh, Kent and Lauren, unfortunately, couldn't be part of the interview because, uh, they were dealing with, uh, you know, just personal matters.
Uh, as anyone who listens regularly might know, uh, they're, uh, house had burned down.
So they're still wrapping that up.
Everything's working out fine.
But they still have that, you know, they're still dealing with that stuff, and getting that together.
Uh, so they couldn't be part of the interview.
But hopefully, uh, we'll be all together again for the, you know, next episode of Killscreen, uh, where we'll go back to the normal format of, uh, watching a movie and, uh, talking about it.
Uh, but, yeah.
For this, I just was, uh, I was just interested...
I'm a fan or Red Letter Media.
I'm a fan of Previously Recorded.
So, uh, I just was interested in the opportunity to talk to these guys about this stuff, and just hear their opinions and, um, it was a really fun conversation.
And I hope, uh, you guys enjoy it.
So without further ado, Jack Packard and Rich Evans.
So, uh, just to give a little background to our listeners, um, how did each of you get involved with, uh, Red Letter Media?

RICH:
I, I just went to high school with Mike.

CRAIG:
Well, that's, that's one way.

JACK:
You know, sometimes it's about the people you know, you know?

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
I mean, we've been, we've been, we've been making, you know, goofy videos since we were high school kids, I guess.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
It's always been our, our hobby.

CRAIG:
Right.
What made you guys, like, uh, I guess, decide to, like, um, just to, like, make it into a thing, like a studio?
Like a normal...
Like a regular job?

RICH:
Slow evolution?

CRAIG:
Oh.
Okay.

RICH:
Really.
That's what it was.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
We, we made shitty videos in high school.
We made slightly less shitty videos in college.
And, you know, YouTube became a thing.
And, you know...

JACK:
And it's, it's, it's just, you know, one day, you just kind of realize, like,
"Maybe I could just make videos?"
You know, like, that revelation of, uh, understanding like,
"I could do this for work."
It, it's, it's a frightening, frightening prospect.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
We...
I, um, I have, uh...
I'm part of a production group here in Louisville, and we just, we just did a, um, like, the first season of a web series called Bag and Board.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
And, um, it, it's a, it's a great show, but, like, it's, it's, like, we're, now we're at that point, we're like,
"How do we get people to watch it?"
It's, like, that's the tricky, that's the tricky part.

RICH:
That's, that's the tricky part.
That's the, the magic.
That's the...
You have no control over that.

CRAIG:
No, not at all.
Like, I, I tell people all the time, like, making the actual thing is the easy part.
Getting anyone to give a shit, that's the hard part.
That's the damn near impossible part.

JACK:
Absolutely.
One of the, uh...
There was, there was so many, you know, like...
Outside of Red Letter Media, inside of Red Letter Media, there was just so many, so many videos that you just, you throw up there.
Like spaghetti, hoping some will stick.

CRAIG:
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I  guess, like, um, the, uh, was, was it the, uh, the, the Phantom Menace review that got you guys in the spotlight?
Or were you already sort of...

RICH:
No.
That's what got us in the spotlight.
Um, one day, one day, years ago now, uh, Mike, uh, sent me a link to a video he made.
I was, you know, I had no idea he was even doing it.
He was doing, uh, a review of Star Trek Generations.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
As, as, as Plinkett.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
And, uh, he didn't think much of it.
To him, it was just something, you know, he was working on it.
He, he didn't like Star Trek Generations.
And he wanted, he wanted to articulate himself.
And then I watched it.
Because I didn't, I didn't have a hand in that.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I, like, I was like,
"This is, this is genuinely good."
"Like, Mike, this could go somewhere."
"You have to keep making these."

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
And, uh, there was, like, a slow buildup.
He did, like, the, The Next Gen movies, even though the first one had, like, a few hundred views.
And then we got 700 views.
A thousand.
"Ooh!"
"Ooh!"

JACK:
"Holy cow."
"A thousand views?"

RICH:
A few thousand.
And, and then the, we did the Star Wars because it had Star Wars on it.
Suddenly we got, like, you know, a million views.

CRAIG:
Oh, man.
That's awesome.

JACK:
That got the, that got the attention of some, some bigger-named people.

RICH:
Yeah.
It did.
It did.
He got noticed by someone, and tweeted it out, and,
"Here you go, you're viral."

JACK:
And then the, the rest is history.

CRAIG:
I think, I think, I think the reason that went viral is it was, uh, it was an important catharsis that people needed.

JACK:
Absolutely.
Right place.
Right time.
We were...
It had been enough time, the grieving period was over, and we were ready to start being angry at the prequels.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
And, luckily, Mike was there to give us an outlet.

RICH:
The hero we need.

JACK:
He was the hero we deserve.

CRAIG:
Well, I, like, remember the first time I w-, the first time I watched, uh, one of those videos was, was the Generations one.
The Star Trek one.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
And the, uh, the scene with the Kurlan naiskos...
That made me laugh until I was crying.
Like, I was crying laughing at the, just, like, the shattered vase.

RICH:
It's a great...
For one, it's a great sound effect.

CRAIG:
Oh, yes.

RICH:
It's an amazing sound effect.

JACK:
It's...
No, it's a horrible sound effect, because you start hearing it in everything.
It's in every TV show.
It's in every movie.
And I hate, I hate that Mike exaggerated it so much because now I just hear it everywhere I go.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Me, too.
I think they, I think they did that gag in the new, uh, uh, wh-, uh, Wet Hot American Summer show.
Like, I, I could've sworn they were doing the shattering sound, the jar shattering sound effect gag in, like, every episode.

JACK:
Well, that...
Well, that...
I'm, I just, I happened to be a Wet Hot American Summer fanboy.
That, that's actually a callback to the movie.

CRAIG:
Oh, really?

JACK:
They, they do the same thing in the movie where constantly things were, uh, shattering off screen.

CRAIG:
Okay.
I forgot...
It's been a while since I'd seen the, the movie.
So, like, I, I should've watched it right before the series, but I just...
I dunno.
I just got right to the series.

JACK:
That's your fault.

CRAIG:
That is my fault.

JACK:
Rectify this as soon as possible.

CRAIG:
I should've prepared better for this interview by watching Wet Hot American Summer.

JACK:
That's how you prepare for every interview.
I agree.

CRAIG:
Um...

RICH:
I hope you've watched Nell.
Because we just plan on talking about the Jodie Foster film Nell for the next hour and a half.

CRAIG:
Oh, shit.

JACK:
"Nae..."

RICH:
That's our, that's our...
It's all my notes have.

JACK:
"Nae, nae, chickabee."

RICH:
"Nae, nae, chickabee."
"T'ee an me."

CRAIG:
You, you, you couldn't...

RICH:
Nobody, nobody is listening knows what the fuck Nell is.
It's just like,
"What, what's that?"

JACK:
I fucking love Nell.

CRAIG:
So what made you guys decide to start, uh, Previously Recorded?

JACK:
Well, you know, I was kind of, uh, as far, as far as RLM is concerned, I'm kind of the new guy.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Of course, you know, I've been hanging out with the guys for, like, five, six years now.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Well, longer than that making other stuff.
And, uh, what would happen is, we'd all get together as a group, either to shoot something or not to shoot something, and just naturally Rich and I, who I didn't even know beforehand.
Rich lived in Chicago...

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
For a long time.
And I lived up here in Milwaukee.
So I, I met Mike and Jay.
And I knew of Rich Evans.
I knew the...

RICH:
The legend.

JACK:
The legend.

CRAIG:
All right.

JACK:
But I, I'd only, like, worked with him a couple times.
Been in the same room with him a couple times.
And, uh, we would just kind of naturally gravitate toward, toward each other.
And, you know, like, I would say to the room,
"Hey!"
"Anybody hear the, the big video game news?
"Huh?"
And, and Jay's eyes would glass over and would leave the room.
And Rich would go,
"Oh, yeah!"
"I heard about that!"
So we would just, like, scoot together naturally.

RICH:
Mike and Jay are not video game guys.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
Moreso Mike, even.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah, he seems damn near grumpy about video games.

RICH:
For the longest time, Mike was, like, you know, he sees me as the video game guy because I know what video games are.
And he's like,
"You should do a video game thing."
Every, every so often this would come up.
"We should do a video game thing."
And then we did Game Station.
It was, it was fucking horrible.

JACK:
Was it three episodes?

RICH:
It was, like, three or four episodes.
And Mike still was like,
"You should do a video game thing."
Even after that failed.
I'm like,
"Mike, I, I can't do this alone."
"I need somebody else."
"Like, ehh, why don't I get Jack?"
"Why not get Jack?"
"We've been talking about video games lately."
"Jack knows what a video game is."
"You like FTL."

JACK:
I played a video game or two.
Yeah, yeah.

CRAIG:
Nice.
Um...

JACK:
And, you know, it was also a show that could be produced because I'm also a video producer.
It's something that can be made outside of Jay and Mike.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Which they...
For them, it's like, 
"I don't need to edit the stupid video game show, and we get more content to put on the site, and that's great."

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
I bet it really...
I bet they like that they get a little bit more time padded out to edit other stuff.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.
Absolutely.

CRAIG:
Sort of a free week.

JACK:
Exactly.
Gives them a little bit of a breather and adds to the, the menagerie.

CRAIG:
Nice.

CRAIG:
So, like, what, uh, what's the criteria, like, for, for games you guys want to cover on the show?

RICH:.
That's a great question.
And I have no idea what it is.

JACK:.
We are still figuring that one out.
We, it, a lot of it is just what we feel like we have something to say about.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:.
You know, No Man's Sky, you know, was our most recent Previously Recorded.
And that one was just a giant E3 showcase for three years in a row.

RICH:.
And so, you know, like, a huge amount of hype.
A lot that we could talk about, even if the game was boring..
There was a lot we could talk about.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:.
We knew we were gonna do that.
Luckily, we had enough we could talk about.
But, like, just recently, we, we decided we wanted to do, uh...
I decided we wanted to do, uh, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Um...
Or, no...

RICH:
That was the new one.

JACK:
That's the new one?

CRAIG:
That's the new one?
Okay.
Yeah.

JACK:
And, and I...

RICH:
I was reluctant because I hadn't played Human Revolution yet.

JACK:
Oh.
And I've never played any of the Deus Ex games.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Neither have I.
I've heard they're good, though.

JACK:
That's what, that's what I hear.
And, uh, they're, they're huge.
They're, that's a big franchise.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And so I, I thought that would be a great show.

RICH:
Moderately.

JACK:
Sure.
Moderately big franchise.
And I started playing it.
And Rich still had reservations.
And I got about 6, 7 hours of play time, and couldn't think of a damn thing to say about it, negative, positive, or otherwise.

RICH:
I, I enjoyed it.
I was enjoying my Deus Ex experience.
The problem is, that's like a, that's like a really long fucking game.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And we don't get, we don't get, you know, pre-release shit.
You know, we, we get the shit after it comes out.

CRAIG:
Uh-huh.

RICH:
By the time, by the time you fully play a game like that, and get a review, and edit the review, the game's been out for two months.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
So, so we ended shelving that, and we're looking at other options now.
It's just whatever we feel like.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Which is, which is nice, and also bad, because we don't have a, a regular release schedule, and I would love a regular release schedule.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
I love scheduling stuff.
It, it...

RICH:
We should, we should start doing more retro things that we're already kind of familar with.
We don't have to worry about playing a 40-hour game.

JACK:
Yes.
Agreed.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I mean, uh, it seem like it's been a while since you guys have done a retro, some sort of retro review.

JACK:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Um, so, what qualities do you guys, like, look for in a game?
That you consider it a good game.

RICH:
Well, that's, that's not, that's not...
There's not one answer to that.

CRAIG:
Sure.
No, no.
Yeah.

RICH:
You gotta, you gotta game like Deus Ex, which Jack was largely indifferent to.
But I, I was enjoying it.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
You know, that's good.
But I also like Tetris.
And there's, like, nothing in common.

CRAIG:
Right.
Yeah.
Every game has, like, you know, of course, like, different appeals, I guess.
Um...

RICH:
It's, it's hard to say there's one way to make a game, and that is good, and...

JACK:
And, and so much depends on your mood.
You know, uh...

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Like, there are, there are some days where...
Like, like, when I was playing Deus Ex, I was also playing that new, um, free-to-play...

RICH:
Dual, or something...

JACK:
Deck-building game, Dualist.
I don't know if you've, if you've heard of this one.

CRAIG:
No.
I haven't.

JACK:
It's, it's called Dualist.
And it's a free-to-play game that's, like, deck-building and, and strategy.
But you a game of Dualist, it takes maybe 5, 10 minutes.
It's just a real quick in-and-out game.
And then, of course, Deus Ex is, is, you're gonna spend six hours and feel like you've accomplished nothing.
But it's an, an incredible experience.
And I, I wasn't in the mood for Deus Ex.
I wasn't in the mood to get immersed into something.
I just wanted five minutes and a simple strategy.

RICH:
Time's, time's a factor, too.
Because, uh, my, you know, my personal...
I've, I've had a lot going on.
Nothing bad.
But just, I've been very busy...

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Lately, in general.
I've been wanting to play the Deus Ex, even though you don't wanna do it anymore.
I wanna play through it.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I wanna, I wanna revisit the Thief series

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
Those are, those are very, you know, like, immersive, kind of long games.
You gotta get into it.
And I just haven't had the time.
Whenever I've been playing a game lately, it's been something like Rocket League, where I can just knock out a couple of matches in 10, 15 minutes that I got free, you know?

JACK:
Exactly.

CRAIG:
Right.
Well, yeah.
You make a good point, Jack, too, about how mood is a factor.
Because I know the, the one thing I can think of.
I remember the first time I ever played, uh, No More Heroes, which I know Rich, it's one of your favorites...

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
One of your favorites.
I, uh, the first time I played it, I hated it.
I just hated it.
And it was, like, you know...
But, but at the time, it was, like, I was, uh, I think if I remember correctly, I was playing it over, over at a friend's house the morning after a party.

RICH:.
Uh-huh.

CRAIG:
So, I, I kind of, I kind of had a hangover.
And I was just killing time.
And I put in No More Heroes, and I'm just, like,
"I can't do this."
"I can't do this right now.".
"This is too much."

JACK:
You probably had a headache, and feeling queasy.
And there's bright flashing lights, and you were done with it.
Absolutely.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
And then there's also just the, the Wii.
Just the Wii controls can be daunting when you're not in the mood.

JACK:
Sure.

CRAIG:
Just like,
"Oh, god.".
"I have to weigh..."

RICH:
I'll, I'll say, I'll say this, though.
No More Heroes is the one game that really uses Wii controls well.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I agree.
And I definitely turned a corner.
I gave the game another chance, and I really enjoyed it.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Uh, and I, I love the second one.
I actually like the second one more.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Is that your feeling, too, Rich?

RICH:
Oh.
I only give about as much.
No, the second one, it's, it's incrementally better, gameplay-wise.
I would argue some of the bosses aren't as interesting.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
But, it's pretty good.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
They, they, they sort of, I felt like the, the, they trimmed the fat, uh, a little bit.
so it's a little bit, uh, stream-, it's more streamlined.
You guys, I feel like in particular, may-, maybe that's just because I, I watch pretty much...
I, I think your show is probably the only YouTube show I watch about video games.
So maybe other YouTubers...

RICH:
Thank you.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I, I really enjoy it.
And I think, uh, I think other YouTubers maybe experienced this, but, uh, what, what do you guys, how do you guys feel about, like, the backlash you'll sometimes get for your opinion on a game?

RICH:
Oh, you just have to ignore it.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
You just ignore it?

RICH:
Well, it, it...
There's always gonna be somebody who doesn't like what you say.

CRAIG:
Sure.

RICH:
Always.

CRAIG:
Sure.

RICH:
You can't, you can't, you can't dwell on it.
You can't get bent out of shape out it, uh, about it.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
You gotta realize there's also a lot of people who like what you're saying, that generally agree with you.
"Yeah, that was a good point."

JACK:
Oh, sure.
I mean, it's, I mean, it is frustrating.
Especially because, you know, we take the time...
We, we have our conversation.
You know, usually when we do one episode of what we talk about for an hour.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And I'll edit it down to 20, 30 minutes or whatnot.
And I try to make our, our, our opinions as concise as possible.
And, you know, like, drive home the points with videos exp-, you know, helping explain.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And so sometimes it does feel that people just don't get what you're saying, and that's super frustrating.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
What's, what's frustrating is when they bring up something that I know we talked about, but just didn't make the edit for whatever reason.

JACK:
Ooh, yeah.

RICH:
And that the most frustrating thing is like,
"Well, we knew."
"We knew."
"I said something."
"Oh..."

JACK:
Sure.
But I had to cut it out because there was a weird noise, or it didn't flow properly.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
That's actually something that's, that's really nice about the livestreams...

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
That we do is, it's a chance to have a back-and-forth with people.
And some-, sometimes it's more productive than other times.
I know with No Man's Sky, there was, there was a couple, there was a couple who were just, just beating on us for hating that, but...

CRAIG:
Oh, um, on...
During the stream?

JACK:
During the stream, yeah.

CRAIG:
Oh, man.

JACK:
But, but, also it gives us an, an opportunity to have a more in-depth conversation about what we think.
And, you know, sometimes the chat will bring up a point, and we'll be able to counter that point and actually have a, some sort of back-and-forth, which is very nice.

RICH:
Excuse me.

JACK:
Rich just stepped on a duck.

CRAIG:
Oh.

JACK:
I don't know how that duck got in here.

CRAIG:
Um, so, uh, something I, I notice in the stream, um, a lot is people will get f-, like, people will get fix-shated, um, on...

RICH:
"Fix-shated?

CRAIG:
Fixated. I'm having trouble saying words. Fixated.

RICH:
You're pulling a Rich Evans.

CRAIG:
You're pulling a Rich Evans.

RICH:
I so rarely get to correct other people.

JACK:
It's contagious.
Oh, god.

CRAIG:
I'm honored to be corrected by you, Rich.
Uh, somebody like to...
They, they get, they seems to, like, um, you know, fixate on, uh, stuff that you guys don't like for whatever reason.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Uh, maybe like genres.
Like, I know, uh, for example, you, Rich, a lot of people, um, in the, in the chat, anyway...

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Are well, well aware that you, you don't like JRPG's.

RICH:
Yes.

CRAIG:
Um...
And so they can't stop...
Sometimes they just can't seem to stop either...

RICH:
They don't, they don't get it.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
They don't get it, yeah.

RICH:
They keep, they keep recommending other ones, because I guess I just haven't played the right one yet.

JACK:
You have to play them all until you find the one that convinces you it's a worthwhile genre.

RICH:
People...
When...
I think, I think when people are fans of you, though, they want you to like the same things that they like.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And, and it's distressing when you don't.

JACK:
Well, you know, like, these people, obviously, you know, they, they, they watch us a lot, and perhaps they agree with us a lot.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
And so they've built up in their head like,
"Oh."
"Every opinion that Jack and Rich have, I'm going to share, because I've shared all of their opinions up to this point."
And then we hit that one where it's, you know,
"Ehh, I'm not super big into anime."

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And it breaks their, this relationship...

RICH:
It drives everyone nuts.

JACK:
Right.
Well, it breaks the mold that they have of us.
"No, you just haven't seen the right one."

CRAIG:
I can relate to that.
I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why I actually your show, and your, uh, stream, is, uh, because your opinions aren't always aligned with mine, and so I find it more interesting to hear a different perspective, I guess, on something that I...
Like, you know, I, I'm a fan of The Last of Us.

JACK:
Oh, no!

RICH:
You are allowed to be.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Exactly.
And so I enjoyed the game, but I actually found it very interesting to watch you play it, Rich...

RICH:
Yeah?

CRAIG:
Because it was interesting to basically, I guess, witness your experience of the game.
Uh, and just why you would, why you would hate it.
Because, like, I, I could sort of symp-...
Even though I liked the game, while you were playing it, I kind of sympathized with you a little bit.
I was like,
"Okay."
"Okay."
"I can see why, I can see why it just is..."

RICH:
That's just...

CRAIG:
Yeah.
"I can see why he's not into this."
You know, I mean, uh, so, I mean, I think that appeals to me.
But I think maybe, maybe people, uh, other people...
Yeah.
Like you, like you said, they, they rely so much on your opinion.
They don't know what to do when it's, like, suddenly, you know, different than theirs...

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Or, uh, also I think a lot of people, especially nowadays, they, they maybe attach too much of their personality to the stuff that they like.
And so when, when you guys, when, when it's trashed by someone, it's, like, an affront to them.
You know?

RICH:
It's, it's the same with politics.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Exactly.

JACK:
Absolutely.
Well, you know, these, uh, pop, these pop culture things, you know, movies, comic books, video games, we, we kind of throw them, them up as flags.
You know, like they did in the old sailing times.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
To help identify ourselves, right?
So, so I throw up the little flag there that says,
"I like Super Mario Bros."
And then other people who see that we have a kinship.
"Hey, we both like Super Mario Bros."

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
"We can be brothers."

RICH:
See, I'm a hermit.
I don't sell flags.
I just want to be left alone in my little boat.

JACK:
Oh...

RICH:
Like, I got a tiny boat.
I'm living off the sea.
Just stay, stay the hell away from me.
I, I don't need to fly my flag out.
No, that's fine.

JACK:
That's sad.

RICH:
No.
That's fine.
I'm just, I'm naturally a hermit.

CRAIG:
No.
I, I, I, I relate to that.

RICH:
I play games specifically not to interact with other people.
When I wanna avoid that, that's when I turn on the game.

JACK:
Yeah, yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I, uh, you, you've talked about how, uh, you hate multiplayer games for that reason.
And I, I was...
When, whenever you would say it, I know, uh, when I would listen to that, I would sort of pump my fist in the air because I'm like,
"Oh, I totally understand what he's saying right now."
Like, I get that.
I totally get that because, like, yeah, I play video games as a way to relax.
Like, not to get...
I don't wanna get worked up and angry.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
And, uh, and, uh, have a, like a negative social experience while I'm playing the game.
Because that's not why I'm playing it, you know?

RICH:
There's always a jerk you run into.

CRAIG:
Oh, absolutely.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
But, but the, there's a flipside to that coin, which is you could have an amazing experience, and work together as a team, and believe in the power of humanity once again.

RICH:
Or I could just turn on DOOM and shoot a bunch of monsters.
That's fun.

CRAIG:
Exactly.
Um, uh...
So to prepare for this interview, I, uh, I finally got around to watching Space Cop.

RICH:
Uh-oh.

CRAIG:
And I wrote a very thorough review that I'm gonna read right now.
No, I'm just kidding.

RICH:
Okay.

CRAIG:
No, I enjoyed it.
I enjoy the, uh...
I enjoyed the movie.
I was, uh, I was very impressed.
Like, um, it, you know, I, I like the special...
I thought the special effects, um, uh, were good.
Like, it's...
I know you guys were going for...

RICH:
You can thank Jim and Colin for a lot of that.

JACK:
Oh, yeah.
The Canadians...

RICH:
The Canadians, man.

JACK:
Are, are magic workers.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Absolutely.
I thought they did really well.
And I like the balance between, um, like, the special effects that they, that they did.
And then just the miniatures.
And, uh...

RICH:
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Like, the, yeah.
The, yeah.
The way you guys try to sort of make it look like sort of a, like a cheesy sort of, uh, sci-fi movie.
Uh, at least I hope that's why, what you guys were doing.

RICH:
Some, sometimes you make a low-budget movie because you have a low budget.

CRAIG:
Oh, okay.

RICH:
You have to embrace that.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
You have to roll with it.
Absolutely.

CRAIG:
Oh, sure.
Um...
But, uh, yeah.
I thought it was good.
And I thought you did really well, too, Rich.
I just wanted to, wanted to say that.

RICH:
Thank you.
Thank you.

CRAIG:
I thought you, uh, played that character, uh, pretty perfectly.
It was an interesting, it's an interesting protagonist.
Uh, uh, a character that doesn't want to save anyone.
He just, just kind of wants to be left alone in his little boat, like you were talking about earlier.

RICH:
You know, I, I recently, like, like, last week I watched Hot Fuzz for the first time.

CRAIG:
Oh, nice.

JACK:
For the first time?

RICH:
And I, I didn't even realize it.
Apparently I was doing a Simon Pegg impression with Space Cop.

JACK:
And you know what?
I didn't put that together.

RICH:
In the last quarter of that movie, when he's just shooting everything, he's got the,
"Yeah."
"I'm a hard-nosed cop."

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I guess so.

JACK:
He was just doing an early Rich Evans impression.

RICH:
Maybe.
Maybe.

JACK:
That's it.

CRAIG:
Um, well, I have to ask, what, what did you think of Hot Fuzz?
Because it's...

RICH:
Hot Fuzz is amazing.

CRAIG:
Oh, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.

RICH:
I, I had it pegged for something different than what it is.
I, I was thinking, like, a Super Troopers.
Like, goofy cops.
Ehh, I wasn't that interested.

JACK:
Oh.

RICH:
Goof-, ehh, it's goofy cops.
I get it.
No, no.
I saw the movie.
It's not that at all.
It's amazing.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It's one of those movie that when I saw it the theater, I liked it.
But I wasn't sure, like...
I, I walked out of the theater, and I was like,
"I think I liked that movie."
"But I don't, I don't know why."
Because...
And then I realized it's because the movie completely, um, like, completely reversed my expectations.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Like, it, it just...
It was, it was not like a typical movie experience.
Um...

RICH:
It's not a, it's not a easy, dumb comedy.
Which they could've made.
But they didn't.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Exactly.
Exactly.

JACK:
I think that, like, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have this amazing talent, like...
If you look at Shawn of the Dead, and you look at Hot Fuzz, and, you know, other movies, but those two in, in particular...

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.
They are movies without the cynicism that usually comes along with satire.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
You can tell that they love zombie movies.
For all their faults and all of their budget, they love zombie movies.
You can tell that they love cheesy action movies.
And that comes through the scenes.

RICH:
Here's, here's the theme with their work.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
They could've made, uh, easily made a genre movie.
"It's, it's a zombie."
"It's a goofy zombie movie."
"We're building a movie around where whacky zombie things happen."
But they don't just do that.
They don't just make a cop action movie.
They start with the characters, nd this whole character story that plays out in character relationships, while the goofy genre stuff is going on almost in the background.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Or alongside.
Parallel.

JACK:
Interwoven.

RICH:
Yeah.
Interwoven.

JACK:
Inter-...
It's, it's, it's beautiful.
And I, I mean, I love those, those kind of, like, Bad Boys.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Bad Boys II.
The Rock.
Any, any early Michael Bay, I fucking love with, with a, with a huge heart.
And they, they nailed it why I loved it so much.

CRAIG:
Well, there's, there's, like, an honesty with those movies.
I think that's why they're so appealing.
Like, The Rock, and, and Bad Boys and all those movies.
I feel like they had, there was a genuine, like, they're just making...
I feel like they were just like,
"We're gonna make a schlocky action movie, and just have fun with it."

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Uh, and it sort of, that sort of translates through what otherwise could be considered a bad movie.
Um, I guess that's the difference between, like, when it comes to, like, bad movies that are fun to watch and bad movies that aren't fun to watch.
It's that, like, bad movie...
Which I'm sure you guys are well-versed in.
Well-versed it.
Um, movies that are fun to watch that are bad are fun because the people who made it, I think, had fun making it.
Like, even though it turned out not the way they wanted...

RICH:
Mm...

JACK:
I don't know about that.
I...
Usually what we find...

RICH:
They're oblivious, I think.

JACK:
Is, is the ego has overtaken their ability to make a good movie.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
I can see that.

JACK:
And they can longer see that it's a bad movie.
That's what makes some of the best, best movies.
There's, there's this wonderful documentary about the making of Miami Connection.
And Miami Connection is a brilliantly bad movie.

CRAIG:
Oh, yes.
One of my favorites.

JACK:
And then the creator is talking about, you know, he had never made a movie before.
"But how hard could it be to make a movie?"
"I mean, I've seen movies before."
And, and he...
It almost bankrupted him making Miami Connection.
But he believed in it so much, and at the end of the day, he saw it and threw it in a dumpster.

RICH:
There, there is this movie at RLM that everyone here is very fond of.
We've never...
I don't think we've ever done anything with it on camera yet, called Partners.

JACK:
Oh!
The greatest movie ever made.

RICH:
It's, it's the best movie ever made.
Um, it's, it's terrible.
It's absolutely terrible.
And, like, after we watched it, we looked up the creator on YouTube.
We watched, like, an interview with him about the film.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
He talks about it like he made The Godfather.
How, how, what an important piece of artistic, uh, uh, work that he, he created.

JACK:
Like, we...

RICH:
And he's just oblivious to how horrible the movie is.
Oblivious.

JACK:
We looked this guy up, this guy who made partners, and, and he was a film teacher.
And he would often cite his film, Partners, as, you know, being quality film, and, and used that to teach other students.
We, we got a hold of this movie, and it's, like, it's...

RICH:
It does everything wrong.

JACK:
It does everything wrong.
They, they, they have a scene in which these guys are supposed to be police officers giving a police briefing.
And it's in the kitchen of a house.

RICH:
And you never see who they're speaking to.
You never see, like, the crowd of police officers.

CRAIG:
Oh, that's funny.

RICH:
And there's this magical corkboard, that even though there's three different people...
The corkboard is behind every one of them in their own shots.

JACK:
Like, this guy cannot frame a shot properly, let alone, like, cut a movie together.

RICH:
And he's teaching!

JACK:
And he's teaching film.

RICH:
He's teaching.

JACK:
Ego is the most important thing.
Ego and, and...

RICH:
Ego and lack of talent to back it up.

JACK:
Yes.
That is what creates the perfect movie.

RICH:
The, the masterpiece.
That's what makes the masterpieces.

CRAIG:
That's what creates the Neil Breen's and the Tommy Wiseau's.

RICH:
Yes.

JACK:
Ooh, yes.

RICH:
Yes.

JACK:
The Room is another fantastic example.

CRAIG:
Are you, are you guys excited, uh, for the, uh, Disaster Artist movie?
Because I, I can't, I can't help but be curious about that.

RICH:
Curious about it.
I don't know that I'm excited about it.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I've read the book.
It's a good book.

CRAIG:
Oh, I love the book.
Yeah, the book is so great.

JACK:
I, I've actually never seen The Room.

CRAIG:
What?
Really?
I thought you did.

JACK:
I know...
We...

RICH:
I certainly have.
Jack's, Jack's speaking for himself.

JACK:
I'm speaking for Jack.
We, we do this Best of the Worst show, where we, where we watch bad movies and talk about them.
And The Room is the possibly most famous bad movie in the past, what, 20 years.
And I just never got around to seeing it.
And then, like, I stopped caring because it, it became this, like, bad movie that everyone has to see.
And I just stopped caring.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
I hear really...
I hear the book is fantastic.

RICH:
Yeah.
It is.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
It's, it's one of those books that, while you're reading it, your jaw will drop many times.
Like, it's just, it's kind of unbelievable.

RICH:
Like his second belt.
If you read the book, you'll know what I'm talking about.

CRAIG.
Yeah.
Yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Uh, exactly.
I, I can't wait to see this, this, this, uh, turned into a movie.
It should be, should be interesting.
But, I don't know.
We'll see.
Uh...

JACK:
We like that Franco, in general.
I think he's, I think he's quality.
So, hopefully he does something good with it.

CRAIG:
Well, I guess that there's no better segue than to, from that to, uh, the whole, the whole purpose of this podcast.
Which is, we, we cover, uh, you know, uh, movies, like, based on video games, and then, or, about movies based on video games.
Um, and, so, I guess I'll just ask you guys, why, why do you think, like, most of these video game movies, like, why do you think they suck so bad?
Like, what...

RICH:
Well, I think, I think, a, a lot of the times it's because the creators don't give a shit.
They didn't grow up with video games.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Especially with your earlier video game movies.
And they just don't give a shit.
That's not something they care...
They didn't grow up with Tomb Raider.
They don't give a shit about Lara Croft.
"Let's make a movie."
"Let's get that what's-her-face in it, and blow some things up."
The property's didn't mean anything to them.
That pr-, that, that will probably change with your current crop of filmmakers.

JACK:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like, you know, the...

RICH:
People who actually grew up with games.

JACK:
The Super Mario Bros. movie is, is the...

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Prime example of the creator just not...
I don't think the director of that movie played the video game at all.

RICH:
You think?
Oh, you think it's a possibility?

JACK:
I think that might be a possibility.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
And so, you know, it...
I, I think Rich is right on the spot.
And we're, we're starting to get a little bit of that.
Like, The Assassin's Creed movie with Michael Fassbender is coming out.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
That's kind of easy territory.
We're getting a, you know, just because, like,
"Oh, it's a, it's a time-traveling assassin."
"Make a movie, Michael Fassbender!"
We have, uh, Prince of Persia.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Wait.
Did that come out already?

RICH:
Yeah.
A while ago.
Years ago.

JACK:
Really?

RICH:
Yes.

JACK:
I am not up-to-date on the, uh...

RICH:
No, you're not.

JACK:
I, I thought that was about to come out.

RICH:
Are you kidding?

JACK:
I am kidding.
No.
Or, I mean, I am not kidding.
Because that's Jake Gyllenhall, right?

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
Was that...

RICH:
It was actually decent.
It wasn't the best thing ever.
It was decent.

JACK:
Was it a big flop, or...

RICH:
Uh...
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know what the box office was, but...

JACK:
In my head, that was about to come out.

CRAIG:
I mean, you know, as far as, like, uh, uh, an adaptation of The Sands of Time, which I think they specifically drew from, uh, for that, it's, it's okay.
I think it's just the casting of Jake Gyllenhall is what sort of...
I mean, not that he's a bad actor.
But, like, just casting him as a Persian Prince.

JACK:
Talk to Spielberg.

RICH:
It's, it's nothing Hollywood hasn't done before.

CRAIG:
That's true.

RICH:
Uh, fucking Ben Kingsley got an Oscar for that shit, didn't he?
Or is he...
What is his background?
Is he...
Never mind.
I take it all back.

CRAIG:
Oh, by...

RICH:
Wasn't there one famous, one guy who won an Oscar doing that?

CRAIG:
Uh, for playing...

RICH:
That fellow face kind of thing where...
Or am I wrong?

JACK:
Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure it's happened.
I think, you know, I think the other problem is, especially early video games were kind of light on the plot.
What's the plot of Super Mario Bros.?
Oh, you save the princess.
You jump on some things.
What's the plot of The Legend of Zelda?
You, you save a princess, and you hit things with your sword.
There wasn't...
People didn't have the imagination or the budget necessary to bring those things to life.
And I think we're starting to see a little bit of that now with, like, with Pixar animated features, with Disney animated features.
We're getting a little more whimsical and we're getting a little more adventurous.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
So maybe if, if Nintendo unclenches their buttcheeks after the disaster that was the Super Mario Bros. movie, we could get some decent...
You know, like, a Zelda movie would be fun.
It's a simple lord...

RICH:
It would be, it would be any kind of generic sword fantasy film.

JACK:
Exactly.

RICH:
The, the storytelling in Zelda has never been the selling point.

JACK:
Right.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
See, some, some games, the movies, it's, it's, it's an odd thing to me.
Because you're playing for the gameplay.

JACK:
Right, right.

RICH:
Not every game is a story-focused experience, like the Zelda games.
You just, you collect the items and you beat the dungeons.
The story's a complete fucking afterthought.
Where you gotta, you gotta, with the Zelda movie, what, you get the fucking afterthought story without any of the gameplay?
That can't be satisfying.

JACK:
You know what?
It's an excuse to have a fantasy adventure movie.

RICH:
Sure.

JACK:
So why not?

RICH:
But then you're just watching any old fantasy movie.
You can do any fantasy movie.

JACK:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
You don't need to have the Zelda name on it.

JACK:
You...
Well, oh, you need the Zelda name to get it made, because you can't just make it...

RICH:
Well, sure.
All right.
Fine.
Fine.

JACK:
It gives us...
It needs to be an adaptation of some kind.

CRAIG:
Well, you know, and I think some movies, like, some games make more sense than others, too, of course.
Like, uh, like, we recently watched Silent Hill.
And, um, we enjoyed it, you know, quite a bit, actually.
And, uh, I think it...
That movie, you know, for all its fault, for all its faults, I think it ended up being a good movie because it was drawing from a video game that has a very distinctive, like, artistic direction.
Like, with its graphics and its music and, you know, the theme.
The, the, the, the tone of the stories and stuff.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Like, it's very distinctive.
And so it act-...
There's a lot to work with.
Um, you don't have to make it exactly the same...
You don't have to make an exact duplicate of, of the game.
Um, like, beat-for-beat, you can just do, you, you can sort of do your own thing.
But, uh, you know, if you at least make it familiar, uh, with the game, it's, you know, it's, uh, it, it, to me, it's, it's a successful adaptation.
Um, can you guys think of any, any games that you know of that kind of have that sort of distinct sort of, I guess, um, distinctiveness that would make, like, for a good, like, for a good movie?

RICH:
The only, the only video game that I can think of right now that would instantly translate into a movie would be the Uncharted series, because Naughty Dog does not give a shit about gameplay.
They're basically, they're basically trying to make a movie, and the action set pieces, you have very limited control.
It's all the illusion of, of control.
It's the illusion that you're doing this thing.
It would...
You could shove that right into a movie.

CRAIG:
I agree.

RICH:
The thing...
Here's the thing.
Games that do storytelling well, they don't tell stories the same way that you, that get stories told in other media.
A comic book can translate into it.
You just take the story and you find a way to make the pictures move, you know.
And, you know, you take a book, and you just, you have people act out the things that happen in the goddamn book.
But, like, take, take Sands of Time.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
The way, the way that tells a story, uh, you have the prince and, and Farah, and it's just, like, ten hours worth of them talking to each other.
And you, as the player, develop the relationship with the characters.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
You're, you're an active...
When it's done right, you're an active participant.
How do you turn that into a movie?
They tried.
You know, they did the best they could with Sands of Time, but it's a completely different experience than the game.

JACK:
Absolutely.

RICH:
You know, it, it's...
How do you do a direct translation of Mass Effect?
Mass Effect, you're constantly in the story.
You're making,
"Do we attack over here, or do we hold back and rescue the civilians?"

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And making a movie out of that takes all of that interaction away.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
But you could take, you could take a game that maybe is a little lighter on the story and is really heavy on world-building and atmosphere.

RICH:
True.

JACK:
So, so...
And, you know, this is going to be a double-edged sword example.
But the Metroid series.

CRAIG:
Okay.

JACK:
Which is, of course, heavily inspired by Alien.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
But...

RICH:
Like, like everything.

JACK:
Like everything.

RICH:
Fucking everything.

JACK:
But you could, I think, really easily make a Metroid movie because Metroid is more about the environment and space and these creatures and just a bounty hunter versus monsters.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Boom.
That's easy because you're just, you're just building a world around you.

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.

JACK:
So I, like, mostly because I really like space movies, I would love a Metroid movie.

CRAIG:
I think I would love that, too.
I think that, of all the properties that Nintendo...
If they were ever to make, try to make a live-action movie out of any other properties...
Like, of course, you know, besides Zelda, I feel like Metroid would be their best, their best bet.

RICH:
Not Mario Kart?
Mario Kart: The Movie.

JACK:
That would be...
That'd be part of, like, uh, Nintendo's Cinematic Universe.
Because they'd have the, the Metroid Movie.
And they'd all come together for the Mario Kart movie.

RICH:
Not, not Super Smash Bros.

JACK:
No.
It'd be the Mario Kart movie directed by, uh, the guy who did the, The Fast & Furious movies.
He just did Star Trek: Beyond.
What's his name?

CRAIG:
Oh.
I think, like...

RICH:
Like, Yoshi driving...

JACK:
Jeffrey Lin?

RICH:
A go-kart off a skyscraper.

JACK:
Exactly.
That'd be their version of The Avengers.
The Mario Kart movie.

RICH:
The Great Fire Flower Heist.

JACK:
"All right."
"Listen up, Peach."
"You gotta get to the eighth floor and distract the guards."
And everybody's played by The Rock.
Even Peach.

CRAIG:
That'd be a great climatic...

RICH:
The Rock would be a great Bowser.

JACK:
The Rock would be a great Bowser.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I think that would work.
Much better than...
I don't know if he can be, you know, better than Dennis Hopper?
But, I mean...

RICH:
Dennis Hopper can do anything.

CRAIG:
Oh, you know, he did the best he could with that movie.
With what he had to work with.

JACK:
I guess.

CRAIG:
I mean...

RICH:
Wasn't that a thing because his grandkids were fans?
Is that...

JACK:
Yeah.

RICH:
Is that...

JACK:
Yeah.

RICH:
The story?

JACK:
Yeah.
It was, like, he, he wanted to turn it down, but his grandkids really liked Super Mario.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
And he's like,
"Yeah, okay, I'll be in the Super Mario Bros. movie."
He didn't know how bad it was gonna be.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
He's Dennis Hopper.
He can do whatever the fuck he wants.

RICH:
Well, he could.
He can't anymore.

JACK:
Well, not anymore.
Yeah.

RICH:
His options are very limited right now.

JACK:
RIP.
Rest in peace, Dennis Hopper.

CRAIG:
Um, so, like, what would you think is...
So, from your experience, what's, uh, what would you consider, like, the worst video game movie that you've seen?

JACK:
That I've seen personally?
Uh, I mean, Super Mario is really fucking bad.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I have to rewa-...
I haven't seen that since I was young.
I think I might be fascinated by just how, how wrong it is.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.

JACK:
Sure.
Uh, the Street Fighter movie is an exceptionally kind of bad.
Jean-Claud van Damme as Guile.
Raul Julia as M. Bison.
Um, Meng...
What's, what her name?
Ming-Na Wong as...

CRAIG:
Oh, uh, Ming-Na Wen.
Or, I think that's it.
Ming-Na Wen, I think is her name.

JACK:
She's on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. now, whatever her name is.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
She was Chun Li, like, terrible, terrible movie.
Uh, the worst of the worsts.
I, I have not...
I have not seen any of the Uwe Boll ones.
I heard those are terrible.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I haven't seen those either.
I'm almost, like...
I'm almost not sure if I...
I mean, I'm going to, eventually for this podcast.
But, like...

RICH:
They're movies that were made as a tax dodge.

CRAIG:
Exactly.
That's, that's kind of what makes me hesitant to want to watch them, because...

JACK:
Yeah.
They're almost, they're almost cheating because, like, he almost took a pleasure in trying to make them unwatchable.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Exactly.
Yeah.

RICH:
I haven't, I haven't seen most video game movies.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
But I...
Which, which, which Resident Evil was that?
With the, the, the Wesker fights?

CRAIG:
That was great.

JACK:
Was that four?

RICH:
I think that was four.
That was, that was the best I've laughed prob-, possibly ever.
Possibly ever.

CRAIG:
Yes.
And I, I remember watching that episode where when you guys watched that, and...
You know, yeah.
You're...
I have to...
Now that you bring up, uh, laughing, I have to say, you're laugh is so infectious...

RICH:
It's why they keep me around.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
It's his job.
He has one job here.

CRAIG:
It's so infectious.
So, like, when I watched that episode, and you were laughing at it, it, it really, it...
You know, it heightened my...
It, like...
I laughed at, laughed, uh, a lot more, uh, more at it as well.
And, uh, I think...
It's funny, I actually sent a, um, I think, uh, I sent you guys a tip once telling you a story about how I was watching...
Or, not watching.
But more like listening to a stream while I was working, uh, in my office.
Because I, I sort of listen to it like a podcast, like a lot of people I think would.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.

CRAIG:
Um, because, um, you know, I, I enjoy just a conversation, uh...

RICH:
You know, like a top-notch gameplay?

CRAIG:
I'm one of those people who's never liked other people play games.
Like, it's, it's, like, like, uh, like, I, uh...
Like, it's funny.
Before you guys...
Before I started watching your stream, I was actually sort of, like, really critical of the idea of...

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Watching people playing games on stream.
I'm like,
"What's the point of that?"
Like, I would just prefer to play it myself.
Um, but, but...
I, uh...
But then I get it.
Now I get it.
It's like,
"Oh, it's a conversation that they're having."
"Or, you know..."

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
"Whatever."
That's, that's fun.
It's like a podcast, but with a video game you can watch, uh, while they're talking.
Um, so, anyway.
So I was listening to an episode, and, uh, there was a point where you, when you were laughing about something, Rich...
I think it might've been the episode, uh...
It might've been the, the Mad Max thing.

RICH:
Okay.
The, the...

CRAIG:
When you got hit by the car.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Oh, that was great.
Um, so funny.
Uh, so that happened, and, like, like, my, uh...
I had earbuds in, and, like, somehow, like, everyone that's, that was around me in, in the desks around me were able to hear your laugh.
Like, very distinctively.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's magic.

CRAIG:
It is.
It is.
It's quite magic.
And I, uh...
And so, they were like,
"What is that?"
And I had...

RICH:
"Is that an owl that's dying?"

CRAIG:
Well, it was, like...
And then I had to have a...
Then I had to have a conversation with the people I work with on, on who Rich Evans is, and...

JACK:
No.
His, his voice is, is honestly unexplainable by science.
We, we spend a lot of time, you know, like, getting our microphone levels to be just perfect.
Here in, in the streaming room, we have special condenser microphones hooked up to, uh...

RICH:
Purchased just for me.

JACK:
Purchased just for Rich Evans.
Hooked up to, uh, a mixer that has a limiter and compressor on it, and he still manages to blow the volume out of control.
We have no idea how he does it.

RICH:
Magic.

JACK:
Magic.

RICH:
It's magic.

JACK:
It's, it's science that's not explained yet.
I don't believe in magic.

CRAIG:
Well, like, I, uh, I remember I, uh, uh, I forget what stream it was, but I sent, I sent...
Oh.
Are you still there?

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, I...

CRAIG:
Oh.

RICH:
I arm-bumped the other mic.

CRAIG:
Okay.
Okay.
Um...
I don't remember what stream it was, but I sent the, I sent a tip with that story.
And, uh...
And then you, Rich, you, like, apologized.
You were like,
"Well, I'm sorry."
I felt bad.
Like, I almost sent a follow-up tip to be like,
"I wasn't trying to..."

RICH:
Oh, it's fine.
It's fine.

CRAIG:
Oh, I'm sure it was.
But, but I felt bad.
Because you, you can only have, like, a 200-character limit when you send those tips, so you can't elaborate too much.

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.

CRAIG:
So you basically...
You have to, like, you have to basically be as succinct as possible when you're, when you're telling stories like that, so...

RICH:
That explains why nobody sent a dissertation yet.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.

JACK:
Right?

CRAIG:
Thank goodness for that, right?
Um, so, we...
Okay, so we talked about the worst video game movie.
Have you guys ever seen one that you might consider, like, the best, as far as those, that genre goes?

RICH:
I, I've largely avoided them because I expect them to be bad.
I can tell you I did not hate the, uh, Sands of Time.
The Prince of Persia one.

CRAIG:
Right?

RICH:
That was pretty decent.
It was decent.

CRAIG:
Okay.

JACK:
Yeah.
And I think there was some decent, uh, I think there was some decent things in, like, the Lara Croft, the, the Tomb Raider movie.

RICH:
I, I haven't seen any of them.

JACK:
It's basically a generic adventure movie, you know?

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
I, I'm trying to think of a, like, the example.
Even, even surrounding...
You know what, what movie is really fantastic?
And it's not a video game movie.
But it uses a lot of video game principles, so I'm gonna count it.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Is Edge of Tomorrow.

CRAIG:
Oh.
I love that movie.

RICH:
I still need to see it.

JACK:
You still need to see it.
It's Tom Cruise and, uh, some lady.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And you know, the idea is they get infected with an alien virus, and every time they die, they get to start their day over again.
It's like, it's like Groundhog Day fighting Alien, with Alien fighting marines.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
It's pretty great.

JACK:
And it is a fantastic sci-fi action movie.
And it takes a lot of, like, video game principles of them...
Like, because every time they die, they figured out how they died, and then they can dodge that attack next time.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
They die again, and then they figure out how to dodge that next attack.
And so it's, it's...
I'm gonna say Edge of Tomorrow is the greatest video game movie.

RICH:
Wreck-It Ralph is pretty good, but it's not directly based off any game.
That's just kind of a movie that's vaguely influence and inspired by video games.

JACK:
Yep.

RICH:
About, you know, about video games.
But not specific existing ones.

JACK:
Yeah.
Wreck-It Ralph's pretty fun.

CRAIG:
Oh, I love Wreck-It Ralph.
Yeah.
That's a great, that's a great movie.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Um...

RICH:
Here's...

CRAIG:
Go ahead.

RICH:
Here's a question.
The Grand Theft Auto games.
They're so inspired by other films.
Could they ever make a Grand Theft Auto movie?

JACK:
Uh, legally, they cannot.

RICH:
Yeah.
They'd get sued by Scarface...

JACK:
No, no.
Here's, uh, fun story time.

RICH:
Oh, really?
This is an actual...

JACK:
This is an actual story.
This is an actual story, is, uh, um...
Roger Corman, famous b-filmmaker Roger Corman, uh, one of his first, uh, one of his first movies directed by Ron Howard was called Grand Theft Auto.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Oh.

JACK:
They made a movie way back in the day.
Ron Howard wanted to start directing movies.
So he directed, uh, a movie called Grand Theft Auto, and another car movie...

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Called something else.
We were just talking about this the other day.
The Roger Corman movie.

CRAIG:
I'm just imagining the disappointment of, like, of a, like a, like a, like a millennial or a younger kid that, that sees that and thinks,
"Oh, is this the..."

JACK:
"Is this what the game was based off of?"

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
And so, years ago, as the Grand Theft Auto series was gaining popularity and they were talking about movie rights, of course this movie already exists with the name of Grand Theft Auto.
And we were deep into remaking...
Especially car movies.
This was back in the day...

RICH:
Uh-huh.

JACK:
When the, uh, Fast & Furious series was, was, uh, gaining in popularity.
They got together.
Roger Corman's people and the, uh, Rockstar people got together.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
And they just decided that neither of them could make a movie called Grand Theft Auto.

52m18s
CRAIG:
RICH:
Okay.

JACK:
That was their deal.
So we, we won't see one.

RICH:
Okay.

JACK:
Unless they change the deal.

RICH:
Huh.

JACK:
That's a, that's a fun little tidbit.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
That is interesting.
I didn't, I didn't know about that.
Um, like, that...
I was just sitting there, thinking about the disappointment of, like, uh, watching that movie, thinking it has anything to do with Grand Theft Auto.
It reminded me of when I was a kid and I watched, uh, Return of the Street Fighter, starring Sonny Chiba.

JACK:
Oh.
All right.

CRAIG:
Thinking, thinking it was about Street Fighter.
Like, I thought,
"Oh, this is what Street Fighter..."
"I think Street Fighter was based on this movie."

JACK:
Sure.

CRAIG:
No.
Nothing.

JACK:
How can you do any of the...
Like, you know, I'm, I'm remembering now, now that you talk about Street Fighter again.
Like, the Mortal Kombat movie.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Do you remember that turd?

RICH:
Do you remember the first Ghostbusters cartoon?

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You mean the first episode?

RICH:
No.
The, the, the, uh, the first cartoon.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
The, the, uh, one that...

JACK:
With the monkey.

CRAIG:
With the monkey.
Yeah.

RICH:
When, when they made the movie Ghostbusters, they almost had to change the name because there was a, a children's TV show made in the 70's called The Ghostbusters, about these two whacky guys and their gorilla...

JACK:
Right.
Right.

RICH:
Who went around fighting monsters.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
And, and so right after, uh, you know, the, the 1984 Ghostbusters came out, it was a smash, smash success, the people who, like, owned the rights to the TV show, they went and made their own cartoon show that had two whacky guys and a talking ape.
And I watched that for the first time.
"Oh, a Ghostbusters cartoon show."
And I was like,
"The hell is this?"
"Why do they have a damn ape?""Where's Egon Spangler?"

JACK:
He was in The Real Ghostbusters.

RICH:
That's why they called that The Real Ghostbusters.

CRAIG:
I think, I think that happened to me as well, Rich.
I think I was watching that, and I was super confused about why what was happening.

RICH:
It was the same year I wanted Ghostbusters toys.
And, you know, parents bought me Ghostbusters.
It was a gorilla and two whacky guys.

JACK:
Oh, no!

RICH:
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
It was like,
"Oh, exactly what I want."
"I guess it's something"

JACK:
Right?

RICH:
"I guess it's something."

CRAIG:
Kind of like when your parents would buy you video games for a gift, and they don't know what games are good.

RICH:
Deadly Towers.

CRAIG:
Oh, god.

RICH:
Deadly Towers.

CRAIG:
I'm so sorry.
I got Wayne's World for Super Nintendo.

RICH:
Ow!
Ow.

JACK:
I don't even remember this.

RICH:
Yeah.
You wouldn't.
It's really bad.

JACK:
It's really bad?

RICH:
It's really, really bad.

CRAIG:
Oh, it's horrible.
It is, it is like a bad Newgrounds game or something.
It's...

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
Geez.

CRAIG:
It's terrible.
Like, I...
And, you know, I know, like, I know exactly where they were coming from when they bought it because I loved the movie, so they were like,
"Of course he will love this game."

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
And, uh...

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
It's funny, too, that Christmas, the way they packaged it, like, they decided to do a joke and, like, pack up, like, put the, put the game under, like, a, a bunch of, like, uh, cans of dog food...

RICH:
Uh-huh.

CRAIG:
And so when I unwrapped my present, I just saw a bunch of dog food.
And they're like,
"There's your Christmas present!"
And, uh, and, uh, and then they're like,
"Oh, just, we're just kidding."
"Look under the dog food."And I saw Wayne's World, and I'm like,
"I'll, I'll keep the dog food."

RICH:
"You accidentally, you accidentally put the joke present underneath."

JACK:
Now I kind of wanna play it.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
It's, it's, it's terrible.
Um, so, um...
You know, I, I...
Here's a interesting question I just thought of was, uh, so what, what, what about, like, um, games based on movies?
What, what's, uh, what do you consider, like, uh, uh, the best, a best, the best game you've ever played that's based on a movie?

JACK:
Ooh.

RICH:
Start naming some names.
I can't...

JACK:
Right.

CRAIG:
Oh.
Um...
Oh, me personally?
Okay.
I can start, uh, I know, I know one game that really surprised me in terms of how good it is compared to how shitty the movie is, is, uh, The Wolverine game.
Like...

RICH:
Is that based on a movie?I thought they just made a generic, like, comic license Wolverine game.

CRAIG:
No, actually...

RICH:
Was it actually based on the movie?

CRAIG:
No, the, the one that's based on, uh, X-Men Origins: Wolverine.
There's a game they did...

RICH:
I didn't even know they made one based on X-Men Oranges, Origins, specifically.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was, uh, for, like, the last generation, uh, like, XBOX 360 or whatever.
And, uh, it was actually a really cool game.
Like, uh, they had, uh...
Like, Wolverine would have, like, real-time, real battle damage as you play, as you get hurt.

RICH:
Well, you have to do that with Wolverine, don't you?

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
But this is, like, gory as shit.
Like, they went, they went, like, really far out of their way to, like, just, like, he would get just chewed up by bullets and whatever you get hit at.
And then, of course, when you, uh, you know, if you stand still, he heals up.
Uh, his clothes miraculously heal up, too.
But, uh...
But the, the gameplay is generic.
You know, it's your, it's kind of like God of War-style brawling or whatever combat.
Um...

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Or whatever.
But it was a pretty fun game.
I remember just, like, and, like, the story was actually slightly better, too.
Because, you know, they had more, they have to put more story into it...

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
To justify, you know, the gameplay.
Like, how long the game is.
And so, in a weird way, the game kind of improved on X-Men Origins: Wolverine.
Because they had, they had to actually tell a story, whereas X-Men Origins: Wolverine skipped lots of important points, uh, plot points.
And that's why that, that one was such a mess.
Uh, but yeah.
That was, uh, that's the one thing I can think of that was, like, surprising, uh, surprisingly, uh, surprisingly good game based on a movie.

JACK:
There was a, there was a game in the Playstation 2 era called Alien Versus Predator...

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
And it was, it was a real-time strategy game.

RICH:
Wait.
You're not thinking of the shooter?

JACK:
No.
It's not the shooter.
It was a, it was a real-time strategy game where you could play as Predators, Aliens, or marines.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And it was the most fun to play as the Aliens.
Because, you know, you would start off with a queen Alien.
And then you could, like, you know, you would drop eggs to make more units, and send your units out, and it was your job to kill all of the marines.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
And it was this...
I'm, I'm sure, looking back, it's, it's actually a pretty bad game.
But at the time, I just loved how simple it was.
And murdering people.

RICH:
The, the Ghostbusters game.

CRAIG:
Oh.
That's a good pick.
Yeah.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Yeah.
It's a great pick.
That's, that's, that's as close as you're ever gonna get to a, a Ghostbusters 3.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I, I agree.
That's...
Actually, because of how bad the, the new movie was, like, I actually watched a supercut of, uh, Ghost-, the Ghostbusters video game.
Like, all the cutscenes and stuff.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Uh, and, uh, that was just fun to watch.
Like, almost as a movie.
Just, uh, you know...

RICH:
Jack has not played it.

JACK:
I have not played it.

CRAIG:
Oh.

RICH:
He should.
He should.

JACK:
There's too much...

RICH:
That's one we get asked to stream a lot, and I'm reluctant because I, I'm not gonna talk over, uh, uh, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Harold Remis.

JACK:
Right.

RICH:
And Ernie Hudson.
I'm not doing that.

JACK:
No.
Like, that's a game that you want to, where you want to watch all the cutscenes, and not be bothered by, like...

RICH:
Some gibbering idiots.

JACK:
Chat.
So...
So, yeah.
We probably won't ever stream that one, but I guess we'll just add it to the ever-growing list of games that we should play.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
It's never gonna end.
It's never gonna stop.

RICH:
I played it.
It was great.

JACK:
Oh, well then...

CRAIG:
It's great.
And it's just short enough, too, where it's, like, um, like, it's just short enough where...
The, the gameplay can be a little monotonous and flawed, but, like, it's just short enough where it doesn't grind.
Like, it doesn't, like, get on your nerves.

RICH:
They, they could have used the Ray Parker, Jr. theme song for more than ten seconds.
They could have done that.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
But they did not.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Did they have the Bobby Brown song in there?
I don't remember if they did or didn't.

RICH:
That's the one from Ghostbusters 2?

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
"Well, I guess we're gonna have to take control."

RICH:
No, that one's not in there.

JACK:
"Gotta, gotta take control."
"Gotta, gotta take control."

RICH:
It does have the highly underrated Elmer Bernstein score, though.

CRAIG:
Oh, yes.
Yeah.

RICH:
Ghostbusters has a great fucking score.
It doesn't get any credit.
It constantly gets overshadowed by the Ray Parker, Jr. theme.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Well...

CRAIG:
I agree.

JACK:
That's a song you can sing along to.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah, but that score is so perfect.

JACK:
That score is perfect.
Ghostbusters score is perfect, yes.

RICH:
It's, it's, it's creepy without being scary.
It's still whimsical.

JACK:
Ooh, yeah.
It's whimsically creepy.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
Buh-bum, buh-bum.
Buh-bum, buh-bum.

CRAIG:
It's very distinctive, too.
It's, like, it's one of those...

RICH:
Yes.

CRAIG:
It's one of those scores where you immediately identify where it's from.

RICH:
Dun, dun-dun, dun-dun-dun-dunn.....

CRAIG:
I remember when I first played the game, and the menu had that music playing.
I knew I was gonna like it.
I was like,
"Oh!"
"This is already off to a great start."
Uh, by the way, I just thought off, uh, another game based on a movie that was really good.
Uh, The Warriors.
Have you guys played that game?

RICH:
I have not.

JACK:
You know what...

RICH:
I've not seen the film either.

JACK:
I don't think I've seen the movie either.
Yeah, so...

CRAIG:
Well, uh, the movie is great, of course.
But, like, the, uh, the game was, it's by Rockstar.
Um, and it was just, like, this, uh, really great sort of, uh, similar to how that Ghostbusters game was like a love letter...

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
To everything Ghostbusters, The Warriors was the same thing for, for that movie.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Um, and, you know, they had the cast come back to do voice, the, to do voiceovers.
And, like, they, uh, had, like, uh, really interesting cool supplemental material in the game to sort of, uh, like, little backstories on each character that wasn't in the movie.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Um, and the, the, you know, the actual gameplay was, like, um, really fun sort of brawler-type game.
Kind of like a, you know, modern version of Double Dragon.

JACK:
Nice.

CRAIG:
Um, so that's a fun game.
Um...

JACK:
I know a little bit ago, I, I...
I do board game nights at my house quite often.
And a friend of mine brought over the 1979 board game Alien.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
This is an actual board game that exists based on the movie Alien.

RICH:
And it's just like Candyland, except pictures are of Aliens.

JACK:
Well, it's, like, you, you have, there's, like, you take turns in two parts.
You move your character, and your goal is to get to the escape pod.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
And then you move your alien, and you're trying to kill all the other guys.
And there's, like, vents and different board game pieces.
It was actually a fairly decent board game.

RICH:
Huh.

JACK:
Like, a little bit of strategy, a little bit of fun, and obviously, you play as an alien.
So...

CRAIG:
Yep.

JACK:
That was a fine game adaptation of a movie.

CRAIG:
Did you guys know that they have a board game adaptation of Donkey Kong.

RICH:
I'm not shocked.
I know when I was a kid there was a Pac-Man board game.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
I remember that.

JACK:
Really?

RICH:
Yes.

JACK:
Well, there you go.

RICH:
I believe it had marbles for power pellets.

CRAIG:
I think so.

RICH:
If I'm remembering it right.
I don't know if I am.

JACK:
All right.

CRAIG:
I, I got a board game of the Super Mar-, the Super Mario Bros. board game when I was a kid.
Um...

RICH:
Uh-huh.

CRAIG:
My...
See, here's a recurring theme, I guess you'll see, is my parents, they loved to fuck with me when I was a kid.
So, like, they, when I was a kid and I wanted a Nintendo, they bought me the Super Mario Bros. board game and pretended like that was what I wanted.
They were like,
"Hey, this is what you wanted, right?"
"Mario Bros."
I was like,
"This is not it at all."
And so I'm just sadly playing the board game as if it's the Mario Bros. game.
Uh, but then later that day, my, like, gran-, they knew later that my grandparents had gotten me a Nintendo.
So, but later that day, I got the Nintendo.

JACK:
Listen, your parents sound awful.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
I'm just gonna put that out there.

CRAIG:
They, they had their moments, for sure.
Yeah.

JACK:
No, they were just having fun, I'm sure.

CRAIG:
Um...

JACK:
Something's gotta fill the void.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Absolutely.

RICH:
Never.

CRAIG:
So, uh, so before, um, I let you guys go so you can get to your stream, um, I, I figured what I could do is sort of just kind of do, go through a rundown of, of, the movies that we've covered.
We've already talked about some of 'em...

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Okay.

CRAIG:
Uh, already.
But I know one in particular that you guys definitely watched, uh, are familiar with...

RICH:
Okay.

CRAIG:
Our first episode was Double Dragon.

RICH:
Okay.

CRAIG:
Um...

JACK:
Good ol' Double Dragon.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
So, uh, that was, didn't that win, was that Best of the Worst for that episode?
I can't remember.

RICH:
I don't recall if it was Best of the Worst.
But I do have a Double Dragon fun fact.

CRAIG:
Oh, okay.

RICH:
I don't remember if this, if this, if this got cut out of the episode or not.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Uh, the person who directed Double Dragon was the brother of my high school gym teacher.

CRAIG:
Wow.

JACK:
All right.

RICH:
I, I remember, because he also did the driving ed, and I was in his driving ed car.
And, you know, we were just making chit-chat as we were driving.
He said, uh,
"Have you ever heard of the movie Double Dragon?"
I'm like,
"Yeah."
"My brother directed it."
And I just started laughing.
Rich Evans laugh.

JACK:
And then you failed driver's ed.

RICH:
And I failed driver's ed.

CRAIG:
That's great.
I can't believe that...
No, that, I, you know, I, I would've rememberd that.
That definitely was not in the episode, and I don't know why.
Because that's, that sounds great.
Uh, that's a great fun fact.
Um...

RICH:
I might've forgot to bring it up on camera.
That could've come up, like, earlier that day.

CRAIG:
Oh, okay.

JACK:
A lot of the time we make a mistake of talking when we're not filming ourselves.

CRAIG:
We do the same thing with the podcast.
Uh, sometimes...

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Uh, when we have a guest in here, we'll st-, we'll start talking and, uh, just to warm up.
But then the warm up starts to be, starts to sound like an entertaining episode.
And I'm like,
"Shit."

RICH:
You gotta, gotta tape, tape the warm up, and then you can always edit stuff in if you need to.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah.
I do that now.
But, like, before, yeah, I was, uh, you know, yeah, I would wait.
Uh, but, um...
So, yeah.
The Double Dragon movie, we covered that in the first episode.
Um, we do have a little, we do sort of a thing, uh, in the podcast called, like, How, How, How Do You Fix It?
Like, for the bad movies.
Like, what would you do to make this a good movie.
Uh, how, how...
We won't do this for everything, uh, that we go through.
But, like, how would you guys make Double Dragon a better movie?

RICH:
Oh, my god.
You could always not make Double Dragon.
When they, when they made that, that game was ten years out of date.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
That's true.

JACK:
And, you know, this is just gonna be my answer for how you fix every movie, but it works specifically in Double Dragon, is just make it more like Dredd.

CRAIG:
Oh.
Yeah.

JACK:
And that's how you fix, by the way, because Dredd is a great movie.
But, like, you know, Double Dragon, the whole deal with any of these side-scrolling brawlers was you make it through waves of bad guys until you get through to the boss, right?

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And that's kind of what Dredd was.

RICH:
Shoud it have been something more like The Warriors?
Double Dragon?

CRAIG:
Yes.
That's exactly...

RICH:
Kicking kooky gang members in the face.

CRAIG:
Absolutely.

JACK:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
That's exactly what I said in the, uh, podcast episode, to fix it, is, like, it should be just The Warriors, because that's...
The movie is very...
What's so great about the more, The Warriors movie is it's very simple and straightforward.
It's just these guys trying to get through New York back to their hideout...

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
And fighting through these weird crim-, these weird gangs to get there.
 
RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
That sounds like a great Double Dragon movie.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
It's a double-cross.
They have to fight each other.

JACK:
Oh...

RICH:
Like the game.
That's how the game ends.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
You play as two players.
In the end, you fight each other.

JACK:
Oh.
That's right.
That's right.

CRAIG:
It's the one thing the movie got right.
Because they...

RICH:
Ish.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Well, sort of.
But, um...
So, uh, another movie we watched, uh, was The Wizard.
Uh, if you guys...

RICH:
I've not.

JACK:
You've not?

RICH:
I've not.

JACK:
You know, I keep forgetting, because we watched that...

RICH:
I wanna punch Fred Savage in the face.

JACK:
We watched that at a movie night at the studio once, and I think that's back when you were still living in Chicago.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
That, yeah.
The Wizard is unfixable.
You know why?
You can't make it more like Dredd.

CRAIG:
No.

JACK:
And so...

RICH:
Well, you could.
It would change everything.
No, it's, it's unfixable.
That, that whole...

RICH:
Actually, Fred Savage going through a building with machine guns, that's got something to it.
Take your old Fred Savage.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.
Well, like, it's funny that you mentioned, um, like, um...
Did you say, did you say, Rich, that you wanted to punch Fred Savage in the face?
Is that what you said?

RICH:
Yes.

CRAIG:
Okay.

RICH:
That is a quote, yes.

CRAIG:
Okay.
All right.
I wanted to make sure that was correct because I, I...

JACK:
That's gonna be the thumbnail for this episode is a pic-, a picture of your face saying "I want to punch Fred Savage in the face."

RICH:
Or how about just a picture of me punching Fred Savage in the face?

JACK:
Ooh.
Get, get your photoshops skills working.

CRAIG:
The summary for this episode will be "Rich Evans talks about punching Fred Savage in the face, and how his fans are gibbering idiots."
I think that will go over well.
Um, but, no, like, Fred Savage.
I have a...
It's funny that you say that because I actually, like, interviewed, uh, Luke Edwards.

JACK:
Okay.

CRAIG:
Like, the guy that played the, uh, the kid from The Wizard.
Like, the, I guess, like, the wizard.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Um, and, like, I asked him how, you know, did he get along with the rest of the cast.
Like, how did they get along.
Um, and he talked about how him and, you know, Jenny Lewis got along really well.
And I was like,
"Oh, yeah.""Well, what about Fred Savage?"
And you could tell he was visibly uncomfortable.

RICH:
I feel vindicated, by the way.I feel vindicated.

CRAIG:
You should, yeah.
He, uh, he was just like,
"Um, well, you know, uh, the thing, you know, Fred was, like, you know, going through an interesting time in his life."
Like, he was, like, dancing around, basically, calling him a jerk.
You know, I mean, he was trying his best.

RICH:
Prima donna?
A child star prima donna?

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
I, I've had, I've had some experience with Fred Savage.

RICH:
Really?

JACK:
I can confirm.

CRAIG:
Oh, really?

JACK:
I, I won't go into specifics.

CRAIG:
Okay.

JACK:
But I can confirm all of your worst thoughts.

RICH:
We're, we're talking about this later.

CRAIG:
Interesting.

JACK:
We'll talk about this later.
Not, not when we're recording.

RICH:
No.

CRAIG:
Okay.

JACK:
Probably not a story I can share, uh, while recording.

CRAIG:
I would, I would love to, to hear it once I stop recording.
And I promise I will stop recording.

JACK:
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I'm not trusting you.
I've been burned by that before.

CRAIG:
Oh, have you, really?

JACK:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Oh, shit.
Well, fair enough.
Um, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have, I still, I promise you I still wouldn't have done it.
But, I mean, I see where you're coming from if you've been burned before.

JACK:
Oh, yeah.

CRAIG:
Um, that sucks.
Sorry that happened.

JACK:
Oh, it's all right.

CRAIG:
Um, so, okay.I think...
One other movie I'll, I'll bring up, uh, that we've gone through so far that I think maybe we'll at least, um, will be close to Rich's heart, anyway, is Doom, the movie.

RICH:
Uh-huh.

CRAIG:
Um, have you guys seen that one?

RICH:
I avoided it because I knew it wasn't going to be anything like Doom.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
There's, there's, there's some key ingredients for Doom.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Uh, lone space marine.
Uh, and, and demons.

JACK:
Yep.

RICH:
From hell.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
Those are the two main ingredients.
Preferably, you're isolated on, like, Mars or some distant lonely place.
Ideally.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
You can do hell on Earth, and that works.
But lone space marine kicking ass and dem-, satanic demons from hell, and I don't believe the Doom movie has either of those two things.

JACK:
You know, it's about a group of marines.
So, by the way, how do you fix Doom?

RICH:
You, you have, you, you get rid of, you make it just like Dredd.

JACK:
You make it just like Dredd.

RICH:
You know what?
I'm ashamed of myself, because I started saying something else before my brain said,
"No, it's a callback, you idiot!"
"Do the callback!"
"Oh, yes."
"The callback."
"Jack said that thing earlier about Dredd."
"That's what I should say."
But I fucked it up.

CRAIG:
Well, as you're so fond of saying every now and then on Best of the Worst,
"I fuck up everything."

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Um, but no.
You're absolutely right.
That's, that's how we talked about fixing it in the episode.
I have to say, Rich, so far, you're on point with, uh, how to fix some of this stuff because you're cutting the quick of why these movies suck, and how to fix them.

RICH:
It's been my, it's been my entire life.

CRAIG:
Uh, because, yeah.
Like, the, we watched that movie, and it was just, we were so, we were just so aggrevated because of how simple, you know, like, the, the premise of the game is...

RICH:
Simple and effective.

CRAIG:
Yes.

RICH:
Highly effective.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
And, yeah.
And, and how it would've made, it could've made a really kickass movie.
Um, and, like, they went, they tried so hard to make an elaborate story for a, a property that doesn't need one.

RICH:
But, I mean, you take, you take those sci-fi, and you, you, you blend in that occult stuff.That weird ass occult stuff.
Like, when you just start seeing, like, the pentagrams on the base, that's some creepy effective shit.

JACK:
Oh, yeah.

RICH:
It's a mish-mash that works.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
It's great.

RICH:
Why don't you do that?

CRAIG:
Yeah.Exactly.

RICH:
They're afraid of offending the Christian population of the country.
That's why you don't do that.
But that's also why the film sucks.

CRAIG:
Right.
Well, whenever you, yeah.
Once you start, when you're making a movie, once you start worrying about who you're going to offend, that's kind of the death knell of the movie being any good.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Um...

RICH:
And then we have our, our current situation in Hollywood in a nutshell.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Pretty much.
Yeah.
It's, um...

RICH:
That Deadpool kicked everyone in the nuts.
Said,
"Nope, you're doing it wrong."

CRAIG:
But, of course, the bad thing about that is now they're, they're gonna, they're gonna come away with the wrong lesson.

RICH:
Sure.
Sure.

CRAIG:
And they're gonna make movies that are as, as offensive as possible without any kind of nuance...

JACK:
Nuance or context or just, or, or, or skill.
You know, like, Deadpool is...

RICH:
No, there'll be, there'll be more swears and more bloods, but there won't be anything truly offensive.

JACK:
Sure.

RICH:
Because, deep down, they're still really worried about offending large sections of their audience.

JACK:
Right.
Right.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
It'll be safe-offensive.
"Look at all that blood!"
"It's hardcore!"

JACK:
And poop jokes.
And, uh, boner jokes.
All the good stuff.

CRAIG:
Oh, man.
Yeah.
It, it, it...
Yeah.
It's definitely, yeah, a double-edged sword.
The, the success of Deadpool.
So, I'm not, uh...
We'll see how it works out.
I mean, hopefully, if anything, it'll lead to a good rated-R Wolverine movie.
Uh, but, like, you know, we'll see.
Um...

JACK:
I'm, I'm a big X-Men fan.
Uh, and I...
Maybe it's just me, but Wolverine has never been the most interesting character in the X-Men.
He, he is a one-note guy that works in a team dynamic.

CRAIG:
I can see that.

JACK:
He's the angry hothead on the team.
A lone Wolverine movie...

RICH:
He was the scrappy undergod.
I'm not even a huge X-Men fan, but...

JACK:
Yeah.

RICH:
It's, like, on paper, his powers aren't that impressive.
He's got bone claws.
He's got bone claws.

JACK:
He's got bone claws.

RICH:
And he's hard to kill.

JACK:
Yes.

RICH:
But I think his healing factor has, is, has grown exponentially over the years.
I think originally it was mostly, he smells good and he's got knives in his hands.

JACK:
Right.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
And when you up against, like, the Juggernaut, that doesn't, those claw bones, that's not, that's not very, uh, that's not sexy.
That's not...

JACK:
He didn't have the claw bones to start with.

RICH:
He was the, so he was the scrappy undergod over, you know, uh...
What's the word I'm looking for?
Overachieving.

JACK:
Yeah.
But, but that works in a, with a team dynamic.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
You know.
Because then he has to put aside his pride and work together to defeat the guy who's more powerful than the team.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
And I, I, I don't think lone Wolverine movies are a good idea...

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.

JACK:
Is I guess what I'm saying.
As a fan of the X-Men comics...

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
X-Men is about the team.

RICH:
Millions of people disagree.
Millions.

JACK:
And right on top of the pile is Hugh Jackman going,
"Fuck you, mate!"

RICH:
He's not saying "fuck you, mate."
He's ignoring you while he's counting his Wolverine money.

CRAIG:
Well, I don't wanna brag, too, but Hugh Jackman is one of our listeners, so...

JACK:
Oh, shit.
I mean, Hugh Jackman's great as Wolverine, and he should make ten more movies.

CRAIG:
No, I agree.

RICH:
And Van Helsing 2.

JACK:
He should make Van Helsing.

CRAIG:
Oh, god.

RICH:
The Revengening.

CRAIG:
Van Helsing versus, what was it, Frankenstein?
What was that Frankenstein movie with...?

RICH:
Oh.
Didn't they just call it Frankenstein?

CRAIG:
I think it was Frankenstein.Yeah, with, uh, Aaron, is it...

JACK:
No.
That was I, Frankenstein.

RICH:
I, Frankenstein?

CRAIG:
Oh.

JACK:
Van Helsing versus I, Frankenstein?

CRAIG:
Exactly.

JACK:
Sign me the fuck up.

CRAIG:
I mean, they are trying to make a cinematic universe now with those monsters.

JACK:
They're not gonna make a cinematic universe.

RICH:
They, they already did the cinematic universe.
Fucking Dracula teamed up with the Wolfman back in the freaking 30's.

JACK:
Oh, that's true.

CRAIG:
They were the first, yeah.
They were the first cinematic universe, I think.

RICH:
Yes.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
Before we had a name for it.

CRAIG:
Well, I think they're trying to revive that, though.
I think they're trying to, like, now that, because of, you know...
Once again, it's, like, you know, Hollywood learning the wrong lessons.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Like, because of the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, everyone else is trying to think up a universe that they can use as well.
And so, yeah.
Universal monsters are, you know, they're trying to revive that and make that a thing again with a cinematic universe.

RICH:
Like, I think the lesson you need to take away from Marvel is...Excuse me.
If you're gonna do that, you need a strong, single vision behind it.

CRAIG:
Absolutely.

RICH:
Your movies are all gonna feel a little bit same-y.
But they're all going to work together.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
Kevin.
Good ol' Kevin Feige, or whatever his last name...
I can never pronounce his last name.

CRAIG:
I can't either.

RICH:
It's fine.

JACK:
Everyone knows who we're talking about, though.
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

JACK:
Without him, without the one singular vision, it all falls apart.

RICH:
You need that Jim Shooter.

JACK:
Yeah.
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Um, well they have Geoff Johns now, uh, on DC's side of it.
Um, so maybe that'll help?
Um...

JACK:
Yeah, but...
Wait.
Wasn't he the one who made the, The Killing Joke movie, too?

CRAIG:
Um, I don't know.
Was that not...
Is Paul...

RICH:
That I don't, I don't, I can't, I don't know about that.
I'm not sure.

JACK:
I don't know who is in charge of that.

CRAIG:
I'm not sure.
I watched that...

JACK:
I'm not sure I trust Geoff Johns.
Ge-off Johns.

CRAIG:
Well, yeah.
I'm not sure either.
Like, it could be, it could be an improvement.
But, uh...

JACK:
Can anyone truly control Zach Snyder's ego?

CRAIG:
Well, and also just, like, could anyone also...
Because I feel like, you know, I feel like DC's main problem is that they have to go through WB to make the movie.

JACK:
Right.

CRAIG:
While Marvel can make it themselves, you know...

RICH:
I think technically Disney has some say.

JACK:
Oh, no.
Disney has all the say.
Disney, though, is smart enough to say,
"You guys have been doing great."
"We're just gonna let you do great, and we'll take all the money from you doing great."

CRAIG:
Right.
Exactly.

JACK:
And everyone's happy.
And, and WB, WB has yet, has yet to go, has yet to find that person who can make a good movie.
And so WB says,
"We'll fix the movie."
"We'll tell you how to make the movie."

RICH:
How do you feel about the, just the general tone they're going with?
That kind of fake dark.

JACK:
It's awful.
And it's, like, I get it.
They need to visually stand out from the Marvel movies.
That's the idea.
Is when you go to see a cinematic DC Universe movie, you can tell immediately that it's not a Marvel movie.
And when you're fighting for that kind of real estate, that's important.
They made just the wrong call.

RICH:
Everything feels like Batman.

JACK:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
Which, I mean, to go, to go along with a point that you made, you make a lot, Rich...

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
I mean, Batman is pretty much the only interesting character in the DC Universe.

RICH:
Yes.
Yes.

CRAIG:
There's a reason why everything is like Batman is because they, they have trouble figuring out these other characters in a way that would make sense in a movie, uh, and make them interesting.

RICH:
To be fair, Superman can be an interesting character.
He just seldom is these days.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
I mean, he can be, but I wonder if he's, like, is he, he's interesting...
I wonder if he's interesting by himself, or is he interesting when he's, like, you know, uh, juxtaposed with another character to play off of.

JACK:
He, he can be interesting by himself.
The problem is the darkificiation...

CRAIG:
Yes.

JACK:
Of, of Superman.
He, he is not supposed to be the brooding hero.
His conflict comes from not being able to save everyone because he's an immortal god.

RICH:
And he cares that much that he would try.

JACK:
Right.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
That's, that's his conflict and they have yet, they have yet to bring what made Superman a great character in the first place to the big screen.

CRAIG:
Right.
Well, like...

JACK:
In the Zach Snyder movies.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Like, I...

RICH:
I was gonna say Christopher Reeve has got something to say about that.

JACK:
Christopher Reeve's...

RICH:
Well, he had something to say about that.
He's, he's...

JACK:
He did an all right job.

RICH:
He has about as much to say as Dennis Hopper does now.

JACK:
Oh...
RIP.
CRAIG:


CRAIG:
Um...

RICH:
RIPD?
Oh, no.

CRAIG:
Oh, god.

JACK:
The Jeff Bridges movie?

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Wow.
Where did that come from?

RICH:
You said "RIP".

JACK:
Listen, we have to wrap this up.

CRAIG:
Yes.
We do.
We do.

JACK:
It's time to wrap up.
