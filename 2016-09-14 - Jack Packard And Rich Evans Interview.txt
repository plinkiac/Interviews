CRAIG:
Welcome to Killscreen Cinema.
I am Craig Williams.
So this is a special episode.
I, uh, got the opportunity to sit down and chat with, uh, Jack Packard and Rich Evans from Red Letter Media.
Uh, they also, they host their own video game review show on YouTube called Previously Recorded.
So I had a chance to talk to the two of them about video games, about, uh, bad movies, about movies based on video games, and just a great variety of stuff.
And, uh, of course, we, you know, talked a little about Red Letter Media and how that got started, and how that, how they, you know, rose into prominence on, uh, YouTube.
And it was a great conversation.
We had a lot of fun.
Uh, I, I might've been a little flustered to talk to them, as I had to do this solo.
Uh, Kent and Lauren, unfortunately, couldn't be part of the interview because, uh, they were dealing with, uh, you know, just personal matters.
Uh, as anyone who listens regularly might know, uh, they're, uh, house had burned down.
So they're still wrapping that up.
Everything's working out fine.
But they still have that, you know, they're still dealing with that stuff, and getting that together.
Uh, so they couldn't be part of the interview.
But hopefully, uh, we'll be all together again for the, you know, next episode of Killscreen, uh, where we'll go back to the normal format of, uh, watching a movie and, uh, talking about it.
Uh, but, yeah.
For this, I just was, uh, I was just interested...
I'm a fan or Red Letter Media.
I'm a fan of Previously Recorded.
So, uh, I just was interested in the opportunity to talk to these guys about this stuff, and just hear their opinions and, um, it was a really fun conversation.
And I hope, uh, you guys enjoy it.
So without further ado, Jack Packard and Rich Evans.
So, uh, just to give a little background to our listeners, um, how did each of you get involved with, uh, Red Letter Media?

RICH:
I, I just went to high school with Mike.

CRAIG:
Well, that's, that's one way.

JACK:
You know, sometimes it's about the people you know, you know?

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
I mean, we've been, we've been, we've been making, you know, goofy videos since we were high school kids, I guess.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
It's always been our, our hobby.

CRAIG:
Right.
What made you guys, like, uh, I guess, decide to, like, um, just to, like, make it into a thing, like a studio?
Like a normal...
Like a regular job?

RICH:
Slow evolution?

CRAIG:
Oh.
Okay.

RICH:
Really.
That's what it was.

CRAIG:
Yeah?

RICH:
We, we made shitty videos in high school.
We made slightly less shitty videos in college.
And, you know, YouTube became a thing.
And, you know...

JACK:
And it's, it's, it's just, you know, one day, you just kind of realize, like,
"Maybe I could just make videos?"
You know, like, that revelation of, uh, understanding like,
"I could do this for work."
It, it's, it's a frightening, frightening prospect.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
We...
I, um, I have, uh...
I'm part of a production group here in Louisville, and we just, we just did a, um, like, the first season of a web series called Bag and Board.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
And, um, it, it's a, it's a great show, but, like, it's, it's, like, we're, now we're at that point, we're like,
"How do we get people to watch it?"
It's, like, that's the tricky, that's the tricky part.

RICH:
That's, that's the tricky part.
That's the, the magic.
That's the...
You have no control over that.

CRAIG:
No, not at all.
Like, I, I tell people all the time, like, making the actual thing is the easy part.
Getting anyone to give a shit, that's the hard part.
That's the damn near impossible part.

JACK:
Absolutely.
One of the, uh...
There was, there was so many, you know, like...
Outside of Red Letter Media, inside of Red Letter Media, there was just so many, so many videos that you just, you throw up there.
Like spaghetti, hoping some will stick.

CRAIG:
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I  guess, like, um, the, uh, was, was it the, uh, the, the Phantom Menace review that got you guys in the spotlight?
Or were you already sort of...

RICH:
No.
That's what got us in the spotlight.
Um, one day, one day, years ago now, uh, Mike, uh, sent me a link to a video he made.
I was, you know, I had no idea he was even doing it.
He was doing, uh, a review of Star Trek Generations.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
As, as, as Plinkett.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
And, uh, he didn't think much of it.
To him, it was just something, you know, he was working on it.
He, he didn't like Star Trek Generations.
And he wanted, he wanted to articulate himself.
And then I watched it.
Because I didn't, I didn't have a hand in that.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I, like, I was like,
"This is, this is genuinely good."
"Like, Mike, this could go somewhere."
"You have to keep making these."

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

CRAIG:
Yeah.

RICH:
And, uh, there was, like, a slow buildup.
He did, like, the, The Next Gen movies, even though the first one had, like, a few hundred views.
And then we got 700 views.
A thousand.
"Ooh!"
"Ooh!"

JACK:
"Holy cow."
"A thousand views?"

RICH:
A few thousand.
And, and then the, we did the Star Wars because it had Star Wars on it.
Suddenly we got, like, you know, a million views.

CRAIG:
Oh, man.
That's awesome.

JACK:
That got the, that got the attention of some, some bigger-named people.

RICH:
Yeah.
It did.
It did.
He got noticed by someone, and tweeted it out, and,
"Here you go, you're viral."

JACK:
And then the, the rest is history.

CRAIG:
I think, I think, I think the reason that went viral is it was, uh, it was an important catharsis that people needed.

JACK:
Absolutely.
Right place.
Right time.
We were...
It had been enough time, the grieving period was over, and we were ready to start being angry at the prequels.

CRAIG:
Right.

JACK:
And, luckily, Mike was there to give us an outlet.

RICH:
The hero we need.

JACK:
He was the hero we deserve.

CRAIG:
Well, I, like, remember the first time I w-, the first time I watched, uh, one of those videos was, was the Generations one.
The Star Trek one.

RICH:
Yeah.

CRAIG:
And the, uh, the scene with the Kurlan naiskos...
That made me laugh until I was crying.
Like, I was crying laughing at the, just, like, the shattered vase.

RICH:
It's a great...
For one, it's a great sound effect.

CRAIG:
Oh, yes.

RICH:
It's an amazing sound effect.

JACK:
It's...
No, it's a horrible sound effect, because you start hearing it in everything.
It's in every TV show.
It's in every movie.
And I hate, I hate that Mike exaggerated it so much because now I just hear it everywhere I go.

CRAIG:
Oh, yeah.
Me, too.
I think they, I think they did that gag in the new, uh, uh, wh-, uh, Wet Hot American Summer show.
Like, I, I could've sworn they were doing the shattering sound, the jar shattering sound effect gag in, like, every episode.

JACK:
Well, that...
Well, that...
I'm, I just, I happened to be a Wet Hot American Summer fanboy.
That, that's actually a callback to the movie.

CRAIG:
Oh, really?

JACK:
They, they do the same thing in the movie where constantly things were, uh, shattering off screen.

CRAIG:
Okay.
I forgot...
It's been a while since I'd seen the, the movie.
So, like, I, I should've watched it right before the series, but I just...
I dunno.
I just got right to the series.

JACK:
That's your fault.

CRAIG:
That is my fault.

JACK:
Rectify this as soon as possible.

CRAIG:
I should've prepared better for this interview by watching Wet Hot American Summer.

JACK:
That's how you prepare for every interview.
I agree.

CRAIG:
Um...

RICH:
I hope you've watched Nell.
Because we just plan on talking about the Jodie Foster film Nell for the next hour and a half.

CRAIG:
Oh, shit.

JACK:
"Nae..."

RICH:
That's our, that's our...
It's all my notes have.

JACK:
"Nae, nae, chickabee."

RICH:
"Nae, nae, chickabee."
"T'ee an me."

CRAIG:
You, you, you couldn't

RICH:
Nobody, nobody is listening knows what the fuck Nell is.
It's just like,
"What, what's that?"

JACK:
I fucking love Nell.

CRAIG:
So what made you guys decide to start, uh, Previously Recorded?

JACK:
Well, you know, I was kind of, uh, as far, as far as RLM is concerned, I'm kind of the new guy.

CRAIG:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
Of course, you know, I've been hanging out with the guys for, like, five, six years now.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
Well, longer than that making other stuff.
And, uh, what would happen is, we'd all get together as a group, either to shoot something or not to shoot something, and just naturally Rich and I, who I didn't even know beforehand.
Rich lived in Chicago...

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
For a long time.
And I lived up here in Milwaukee.
So I, I met Mike and Jay.
And I knew of Rich Evans.
I knew the...

RICH:
The legend.

JACK:
The legend.

CRAIG:
All right.

JACK:
But I, I'd only, like, worked with him a couple times.
Been in the same room with him a couple times.
And, uh, we would just kind of naturally gravitate toward, toward each other.
And, you know, like, I would say to the room,
"Hey!"
"Anybody hear the, the big video game news?
"Huh?"
And, and Jay's eyes would glass over and would leave the room.
And Rich would go,
"Oh, yeah!"
"I heard about that!"
So we would just, like, scoot together naturally.

RICH:
Mike and Jay are not video game guys.

CRAIG:
Right.

RICH:
Moreso Mike, even.

CRAIG:
Yeah.
Yeah, he seems damn near grumpy about video games.

RICH:
For the longest time, Mike was, like, you know, he sees me as the video game guy because I know what video games are.
And he's like,
"You should do a video game thing."
Every, every so often this would come up.
"We should do a video game thing."
And then we did Game Station.
It was, it was fucking horrible.

JACK:
Was it three episodes?

RICH:
It was, like, three or four episodes.
And Mike still was like,
"You should do a video game thing."
Even after that failed.
I'm like,
"Mike, I, I can't do this alone."
"I need somebody else."
"Like, ehh, why don't I get Jack?"
"Why not get Jack?"
"We've been talking about video games lately."
"Jack knows what a video game is."
