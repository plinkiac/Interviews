The Red Letter Media Guys Return To The Podcast!
https://archive.vn/tq45K (bunnyears.com)

It’s a certifiable reunion, because Macaulay Culkin talks to the Red Letter Media guys (again!) on this week’s Bunny Ears podcast (you can listen to their first appearance from last year here should you so desire).
Mack, Mike Stoklasa, Jay Bauman, and Rich Evans kick off right where they left off and start talkin’ ghosts.
Specifically, Mack gifts Mike with a “spirit box” and they attempt to use it in real time.
They then discuss Mike’s desire to have a paranormal experience some day, as well as a super creepy murder house he’d like to visit.

The guys talk about the fact that a production company is planning to use a CGI James Dean in an upcoming movie, and how the idea totally sucks dick.
This leads them to pitch ideas for their own movie, which would involve the likenesses of a whole slew of dead celebrities and would be called Uncanny Valley.

They pivot to a discussion on Star Wars, specifically whether any of them are actually excited for the upcoming final installment, and why we all have Star Wars fatigue but not Marvel fatigue.
They then do a deep dive into their favorite Star Trek episodes.
It’s a geek oasis, and you’re welcome.
Don’t forget to check out Mike, Rich, and Jay over on their Red Letter Media YouTube channel.
