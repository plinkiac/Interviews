POIRIER:
Hi, guys.
Here we are at the Chicago Comic Con with Mike Stoklasa from Red Letter Media.
How are you doing, Mike?

MIKE:
I'm doing great.
How are you doing?

POIRIER:
I'm doing awesome.
I was exposed to Red Letter Media just a few months ago through your reviews of the Star Wars prequel films.
Now, I know that's not all you've done, but how did how did the the whole concept start out?

MIKE:
Well, I originally started, I wanted to make a review of Star Star Trek Generations.
It was just, like, a pet project of mine.
I had a lot of free time at the at the time, and I was, I had bought that movie.
I hadn't seen it since it came out.
I bought Star Trek Generations.
I watched it, and I was, like, oh my gosh, you know.
I hate this movie, and why don't I just make a like a video essay about all the little things.
Because it's, like, if you're having casual conversation with someone, it's hard to really, like, nitpick the whole movie and kind of talk about it.
So I made a video review of that, and it was like, I think it's like, 25 or 30 minutes long.
Something like that.
And it started to get popular, slowly.
People started watching it, and actually just made it for me.
You know, I didn't really care that anybody watched it.
It was just something fun to do at the time.
It started to get like passed around on message boards and stuff like that.
So I was like, okay, well, I don't really like any of the Next Generation movies that much, so I'm just gonna go on to the next one, and then it kind of snowballed from there, where I did all four of The Next Generation movies.

POIRIER:
And how how many hits are we talking about on those on those videos?

MIKE:
Those were not a lot.

POIRIER:
Okay.

MIKE:
The biggest one, I think, Generations was about 30,000.
And so it was fairly small.
So I decided after that, it's like, well, what do I do next.
I should probably keep doing these.
These are fun.
People like them.
I'm getting a lot of good feedback.
My friend, Rich, is like, well, you know, the next obvious thing to review is Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
And I was, like, ooh, you know, cuz that's, that's, like, so difficult, you know.
It's like, oh my gosh, where do you start? So I made that one, and that was 70 minutes.
So I posted it in seven parts on YouTube on my same channel, and that one got really popular when Damon Lindelof, the producer of Lost and Star Trek, he twittered it.
And then Simon Pegg did, and that just, that was like the explosion moment.

POIRIER:
It went viral, basically.

MIKE:
Pretty much, yeah, yeah.

POIRIER:
And just so we know, how many hits are we talking around the Star Wars videos now total would you say?

MIKE:
Well, it's at about, like, 3.5 million at this point.

POIRIER:
And how does that make you feel?

MIKE:
I don't know.
It's great.
A lot of people really like it.

POIRIER:
Do you feel like a celebrity at all?

MIKE:
Not really, no.
I mean.
People come up to the booth and they're, like, you know, you change Star Wars, you change my opinion.

POIRIER:
You know, what's funny is, I mean, I definitely felt a lot of the same things you did, but I've seen Attack of the Clones a hundred times, but there's so many things that I never noticed until you pointed them out.
And I just think, I mean, for example, how many times have you seen each of the prequel movies?

MIKE:
Not that many, yeah.

POIRIER:
Well, then you're very insightful.

MIKE:
Well, a lot of people say, like, did you have to watch it a hundred times to kind of find everything? It's like, I don't know.
I think I'm just observational like I just noticed little things.

POIRIER:
Okay, now let me ask you, where did the voice come from?

MIKE:
Um, I do the voice.

POIRIER:
Okay.

MIKE:
I do the voice of Mr. Plinkett, that's me.
The voice originally came from my friend, Rich Evans, who did the Mr. Plinkett character a long time ago in short films that we did.

POIRIER:
Okay.

MIKE:
And he is he's in our movie.
He's on our show, Half in the Bag, which is like a movie review show.
He plays Plinkett on camera.

POIRIER:
Okay.

MIKE:
So when I started to do the Generations review, I recorded it in my normal voice, and it was just horribly dry and boring.
I was like, you know what, I need to do this in a character, and I need to have funny bits throughout the whole thing.
Little asides that he says.
Little, little jokes.
And I'm like, okay, and then I started doing it.
It's like, okay, this works.
You know, it works that it's a like kind of a creepy weird guy that's talking about this movie, but making valid points at the same time, so it's a contradiction, you know? I was kind of doing the voice that my friend Rich did.

POIRIER:
So, does he feel he deserves credit for that?

MIKE:
Well, everyone on the internet calls him fake Plinkett.

POIRIER:
Okay.

MIKE:
And so, then other people point, oh no, he was the original Plinkett.
And, you know, it's a different character, kind of, you know.
I made up all the other subplots, and all the stories, and it's, so.

POIRIER:
And now, what about, I'm gonna guess from watching your stuff, that you've got some background making your own films, or your own videos.
Is that true?

MIKE:
Well, I went to film school in Chicago, so, and I've been doing movies my whole life.
And editing is really kind of what I enjoy the most.

POIRIER:
Sure.

MIKE:
So, you know, in addition to, like, the cutting, it's also what's playing underneath the video, too, and the type of video, and you can really kind of, like, especially a documentary, you  can make someone feel a certain way by the images you show mixed with the audio and the voice-over, you know.
So it's, you know, it's just a talent, I guess.
It's what I enjoy the most.
And then when I did the Generations review, that's what I wanted to do.

POIRIER:
Sure.

MIKE:
You know, take the movie's footage, and kind of, like, be able to manipulate it--not manipulate it, that sounds bad, I guess--make a point.

POIRIER:
Sure.

MIKE:
And that's kind of the way that I could express my feelings on the movie was throughe editing.
Right now, we do a weekly show called Half in the Bag.

POIRIER:
Okay.

MIKE:
It's me and my friend, Jay.
We do weekly movie reviews.
We're sort of, like, um, it's on a set, like a bad sitcom set.
It's supposed to be in Mr. Plinkett's house.
And my friend Rich plays Plinkett.
He's back again, the original Plinkett.
And we play VCR repairmen that are.
There's like a little story.
But every week we do a review of a current movie or pop culture or entertainment kind of stuff.
Like, we'll do a review of, a recap of this convention, stuff like that.

POIRIER:
Okay.

MIKE:
We're probably going to shoot another feature film soon.
We did one called Feeding Frenzy a couple years ago, which is still out.
And that's pretty much it.
Whatever whatever we decide to do, you know.

POIRIER:
Are you going to eventually do the original Star Wars trilogy, or have you done that? I don't think you've...

MIKE:
No.

POIRIER:
No reason to, right?

MIKE:
No, there's no reason to.
Other people have done it, where they take it, and they're trying to do sort of like a Mr. Plinkett thing, like, oh, these movies have horrible flaws, too, but they just don't work.
