TODD:
Bad movies beware, because wherever you are, these people will find you and, uh, it’s, it’s gonna happen regardless. Uh, and I’m here with one of those guys now. Uh, of course I’m talking about RedLetterMedia. More specifically, the show Best of the Worst. And I’m here with one of the gang right now. He also hosts, co-hosts Previously Recorded with Rich Evans, talking about all the latest video games going on. Jack Packard. Hello, Jack. 

JACK:
Wooh!

TODD:
You are here, and ready to roll. 

JACK:
I am here.

TODD:
I’m glad, I’m glad. Coming to us from Milwaukee. Let me ask you, why Milwaukee? Where, where, why was that the place to set up RLM?

JACK:
I don’t, that, eh, that’s not my call. This is where I lived, I al - I grew up in, uh, um, in, kind of in between Milwuakee and Chicago.

TODD:
Right.

JACK:
In farm, in farm country in Wisconsin.

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
Very famously grew up on a farm. And I moved to Milwuakee as I got older, as I got out of the farm, and this is just where I’ve been living. And then all of a sudden, these jackasses from Chicago come up here... 

JACK:
Mike and Jay and Rich.

TODD: 
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
They think they run the joint.

TODD:
Yeah, right?

TODD:
That, there...

JACK:
Uh, well, no, I think this is just where, uh, this is just where they ended up. Uh, for awhile they were doing, you know, kind of, uh, for-hire videography work. And I, I just, uh, I met them here in Milwuakee because we all make videos. 

TODD:
Right. How long you been with them now? 

JACK:
Oh, lord. Like, I’m still not technically with them. It’s actually a very strange, we have a very weird business relationship. Like, I am not an employee of RedLetterMedia.

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK: 
I just hang around and they put me in videos. Um...

TODD:
You just walk in and say, “Hey, you want to be in this week’s Best of the Worst?" You’re like “Okay, sure.”

JACK: 
Pretty much. 

TODD:
Mh-hmm.

JACK:
Pretty much. And so, like, you know, but we’ve been making videos together, together, like, oh lord, when, I’m trying to remember my first video with them. I’m trying to remember when the Grabowskis...I’m gonna look it up right now. 

TODD:
Oh, lord. That’s, like, seven years ago. 

JACK:
Do you remember the Grabowskis?

TODD:
I do remember the Grabowskis.

JACK:
Yeah, so maybe, uh, I’ve been with them for about, I’ve, I've been making videos with them for about seven years now.

TODD:
Mm-hmm.

JACK:
And, it, it just so happened, like I said, we met through mutual friends, and I made videos, and they made videos, and, as someone who makes videos, it’s always really hard to find someone to be in front of the camera. 

TODD:
Right, right. 

JACK:
And, uh, you know, we just, we got along immediately, and we had a very similar sense of human and, and, and, now they just, now they just keep me around because I’m usually available.

TODD:
You, they put up the food, you feed, you eat it, and then you just keep hanging around. 

JACK:
Wait, do other people get food?

TODD: 
They do. Yeah. Josh, especially, and I think Rich does. But, uh, but that's just, that’s just, you know, favoritism out of the whole deal, you know. 

JACK:
I think so. Like, I, I have a deal where I can, uh, I, I steal Mike’s energy drinks all the time, uh, and every once in a while I’ll, I’ll take a beer or two out of the fridge. 

TODD:
Okay, I’m...

JACK:
But that’s, that’s about it. 

TODD:
That’s shocking that Mike has energy drinks, because all I see him drinking is alcohol so, uh, he, he seems like he wants to dumb down his senses, not raise them at all.

JACK:
You have to, you know, you have to balance. Like, one energy drink, two beers. One energy drink, two beers. 

TODD:
That, that makes sense, that makes sense. Uh, how dod you and, uh, Rich come up with Pre Rec, what, what brought that on? 

JACK:
Uh, well, that started after Best of the Worse, um, and, you know, I, Rich, was the person who I met last. I, I think I met Jay first. And then, you know, after Jay I met Mike, and started hanging out with them, and Rich at the time still lived in Chicago. And, so he would have to drive up for shoots every once in a whil,e and then when Best of the Worst started, he had finally moved up, and, uh, really, what would happen is in between watching movies, Rich and I would – In, In trying to bring up _____ conversation to the whole group, say, hey did you guys hear about that video game? And Mike and Jay would immediately, their eyes would glaze over. 

TODD:
Glaze over. [laughs]

JACK:
And Rich would be like, “Oh yes, I know of the video games” and I’d say, “Ooh, great, comic books?” 

TODD:
[laughs] Right. 

JACK:
Rich said, “Yes! I know comic books!”

TODD:
Yeah

JACK:
Uh, and we just, we, we, uh, we got along because we were the nerdiest of the group. 

TODD:
Mh-hm

JACK:
And I know Rich had tried with uh, with his old video game show, Game Station 2.0, uh, the only problem was Rich doesn’t know how to edit. And so Rich wrote the script and then either Mike or Jay had to edit it. 

TODD:
Mh-hm

JACK:
And they don’t care about video games, so

TODD:
Exactly. I – I – I think I re – one time you were talking about on that show, they had edited and they did – they did – they wouldn’t put in the parts that Rich was talking about, they would just put in random scenes from the video games, is that right?

JACK:
Right, right, cause they, cause they didn’t care – they didn’t care to go through hours of footage. 

TODD:
Right

JACK:
And so like, it was, it was for Rich’s Vanquish review and he was talking about how satisfying the shotgun felt. 

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
And then they didn’t use footage of him using the shotgun in Vanquish, it was, 

TODD:
[laughs]

JACK:
C’mon guys! This is basic one oh one. 

TODD:
One oh one you’d think somebody in editing would realize, someone mentions a shotgun. I should find a shotgun to put in this scene. This might work.

JACK:
Well, and that’s just how little Mike and Jay cared about video games in general and uh, and so you know, the – there’s always looking for stuff to supplement their videos cause it takes a long time to edit a Best of the Worst

TODD:
Mh-hm.

JACK:
And sometimes no movies are coming out for ______ and they just don’t feel like making anything and so previously recorded was a chance for video content to be made completely outside of Mike and Jay. 

TODD:
Mm.

JACK:
Uh, cause, I can edit and I can shoot and Rich and I can do all the work on that end and, uh, un – unfortunately when we started the show I only had two cameras at the time which is why all the early episodes only have the back and forth cameras.

TODD:
Right, right. 

JACK:
Because I wanted it to be completely separate from, um, Mike and Jay. 

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
And now we just kind of have our own thing, we, we’re off in our little corner of, of Red Letter Media.

TODD:
And that’s nice, uh, cause I love Mike and Jay but their arty farty pretentiousness tends to take it’s toll so I enjoy listening to yours and Rich’s conversations a little bit better, uh, because they just seem to be more, they’re more up my alley, they’re more entertaining. 

JACK:
[laughs] kay, hey, listen, we’re not trying to offend any arty farty people

TODD:
No. No, no, no no. 

JACK:
I am – I love arty farty

TODD:
That’s right, love, and I love Mike and and Mike and Jay but uh, holy cannoli sometimes just sometimes, especially Jay, I , I , I , I and nah I mean look I love Jay, I love Jay, it’s just, there are times I’m like I have no idea where you’re going with that, what does that even mean, I don’t understand you sometimes. 

JACK:
Yeah

TODD:
But it’s, it’s.

JACK:
Sure. They’re old film school people you know. 

TODD:
Yeah

JACK:
I never got into film school so I just started making videos of my own but, you know, they’re the type of people that can – that can talk about, you know, the, the different editing techniques and styles and they go deep into, well this is the uh, the, the coolest shop effects oooooooh yeah, 
TODD:
TODD:
[laughs]

JACK:
we’re referencing Checkhoff’s gun. 

TODD:
[laughs] Yeah, I I I’ve almost turned it into a drinking game uh where, on Best of the Worst and Half in the bag when will Mike bring up Star Trek at some point it will happen.

JACK:
[laughs]

TODD:
When will he bring up star trek? And he always does, it never fails. 

JACK:
Both Mike and Rich are terrible and you know, Star Trek’s a great series

TODD:
Yeah.

JACK:
But you, it it shouldn’t be your point of reference for ever single piece of media. 
TODD:
TODD:
It all doesn’t go back to Star Trek

JACK:
Exacly

TODD:
YEah

JACK:
Exalcty 

TODD:
So have you always been a big gamer?

JACK:
Mh-hm.

TODD:
Yeah?

JACK:
Oh yeah, yeah, I mean, uh, yeah, yes? I 

TODD:
[laughs]

JACK:
I’m trying to you know like, I I’m not saying give my cred  uh

TODD:
Right. 

[Jack]:
I – I have - I have children, I have two children 

TODD:
Mm

JACK:
and so when, when my two children were very young, gaming took a huge dive.

TODD:
Right

JACK:JACK:
Because there’s just no time. Uh, but then I started getting back into it, uh, right around ______ there, 

TODD:
Mm

JACK:
So you know, I have like obviously playedTODD: as a kid, I loved - I had an N64 and 

TODD:
Oh yeah

JACK:
All that, I - we even had a, was it a Sega Saturn? That was our big one

TODD:
Oh Lord, really?

JACK:
Yeah, I - it was a bad choice. 
TODD:
Mh-hm

JACK:
But I was a kid and my mom found it on sale or something

TODD:
Yeah

JACK:
so we had a Sega Saturn we loved the hell out of that. Had all the nintendos, uh, in, in college uh, you know the big, the big drinking game was always Mario Kart. Before you could drive home to make sure you were sober you had to play Mario Kart to prove to us that you were sober. [NEEDS SOME BACK AND FORTH INTERRUPTIONS FROM HERE ON OUT. GO BACK ON SECOND PASS AND ADD IN[

TODD:
That is brilliant.

JACK:
Right? 

TODD:
That is brilliant.

JACK:
You didn’t – if you didn’t perform well enough then you had to sleep on the couch. But so then when the uh – the Xbox 360 era came uh back around and you know the orange box gets released and we, we have uh the _____ and Teen Fortress 2 and the uh the swell of uh, indie games. 

TODD:
Mh-hm

JACK:
Was really fantastic and then as PC game – I’m I’m a Mac user so I wasn’t able to take part in a lot of PC gaming but as ____ came back, more games came to Mac and I got to play a little big more and now I play all the time whichi s great. 

TODD:
Right because Mac is the bomb and I have a mac too and uh, I , I never regretted making that, uh, making that switch for sure. Um, okay, so, we’re talking about Best of the Worst, how did it get started? What, what, what convinced everybody that that was the show to do?

JACK:
Uh, uh, I – I, part of it is I don’t know. Because I actually, I wasn’t there for the first episode that they filmed. 

TODD:
Right

JACK:
And uh, here’s what I can tell lyou. Before est of the Worst we would get together all the time and just have bad movie nights whether it’d be at someone’s house or at the studio and we had a great time every time and when you’re content creators you’re always looking for the next thing to make and eventually we said hey maybe we’re good enough to film this

TODD:
Right

JACK:
And like I said I wasn’t there that first episode so I, I don’t know whose Idea it was uh to get Best of the Worst started

TODD:
RIght

JACK:
Or who came up with the format or like why is it 3 videos? Or why did they all have to have a common thread? It’s, it’s all, it’s all a mystery to me I just show up and try to make fun of bad movies. 

TODD:
Right. Does it get like almost exhausting trying to make that show? 

JACK:
I

TODD:
Cause I feel like at times

JACK:
[laughs]. It’s not almost exhausting. It is exhausting. 

TODD:
[laughs]

JACK:
Cause you know we – we don’t watch the movies beforehand

TODD:
Yeah

JACK:
You know, like, uh, a lot of people will compare us to something like MST3K

TODD:
Oh yeah, yeah

JACK:

And and, with MST they’re actually kind of watching a movie and taking notes and writing a script and refining the script and then they shoot the script. For us it’s all improv, it’s whatever we can come up with while we watch it. And it’s 3 movies and if you know, if, uh, if 3 movies are 2 hours long each that’s 6 hours and then we talk for another hour and a half and that’s seven and a half hours.  And – and that’s uh, uh, it’s an entire day and it’s exhausting and now that we’re on episode 

TODD:
50 something

JACK:
50? We’re getting close to 50

TODD:
Yeah

JACK:

It. The real hard part is coming up with new shit to talk about.

TODD:
Mh hm

JACK:
And like, how many times can you point out that the boom has dropped in the shot, or how many times can you can you make fun of ush, of uh, camera Mitchell. Hopefully, hopefully we’re never run out of camera Mitchell.

TODD:
