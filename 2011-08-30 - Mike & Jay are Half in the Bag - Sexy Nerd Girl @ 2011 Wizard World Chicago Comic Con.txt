STEPHANIE:
So, we're hanging out here in Chicago this time with our old pals, can I call you pals?
Is that okay?

MIKE:
No.

STEPHANIE:
Okay, not pals.
My acquaintances?

MIKE:
That works, that works, yeah.

STEPHANIE:
Okay, my two acquaintances, Mike and Jay from Red Letter Media.

MIKE:
Well, we've been working on our show called Half in the Bag.

STEPHANIE:
Yes.

MIKE:
People have realized that Jay is person.

STEPHANIE:
Okay.

JAY:
Actually, over the course of the last couple of episodes, people have realized I have a name.

STEPHANIE:
So you're building your own little fan base?

JAY:
No, not at all.

STEPHANIE:
Okay.

JAY:
They just know my name.

STEPHANIE:
Okay, well, I heard you guys are doing some with Machinima now.

MIKE:
Yes, yes.
Episodes of Half in the Bag are going up on Machinima.

STEPHANIE:
Okay.

MIKE:
As well as our own website.


STEPHANIE:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But they're shorter versions for Machinima because of YouTube time constraints.

STEPHANIE:
So it's like quarter, Quarter in the Bag?

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

STEPHANIE:
Yeah?

MIKE:
Yeah, I guess that's an accurate way of saying it, yeah.

STEPHANIE:
Okay.

MIKE:
I tried to talk to Patrick Stewart, but I didn't have $70.
It costs $100 to look at him, and $70 for his autograph, yeah.

JAY:
For $150, he'll make eye contact with you.

STEPHANIE:
For $200, will he shave off his goatee?

MIKE:
I don't know, yeah.
I don't like the goatee.

STEPHANIE:
Me neither.
I want classic P. Stew.
All the time.

MIKE:
He should look the way he looked in Star Trek:
The Next Generation.

STEPHANIE:
Always.

MIKE:
I demand that.

STEPHANIE:
Until the day he dies.
Then he should be embalmed, and just, like...

MIKE:
He needs to be buried in his captain's uniform, and shot out into space, regardless of his personal wishes.

STEPHANIE:
Right.

MIKE:
So where's guy at, that fraud?

STEPHANIE:
He couldn't come.

JAY:
I heard him saying things about guy earlier.

STEPHANIE:
Oh, really?
What do you have to say about my dear, dear friend, Guy?

MIKE:
I dunno.
I just think he's kind of an idiot.

STEPHANIE:
Okay.

MIKE:
He shows up late to things.

STEPHANIE:
Well, you're right.
You're right, he does show up late.

MIKE:
He calls me Mike Stuck-Chuck-a-Ninja.

STEPHANIE:
He's very bad.
He has bad, he has a speech impediment.

MIKE:
He has a brain impediment.

STEPHANIE:
Okay, well, maybe that's a bit harsh.

MIKE:
I wouldn't want to meet him in person or anything.
He seems kind of like a miserable guy.
He seems always kind of negative.

STEPHANIE:
Yeah, he can be sometimes.

JAY:
Well, if there's one thing you hate, it's negativity.
I know that.
You're not a fan of negative people, or being negative.

MIKE:
Very positive.
Very forward-thinking.

STEPHANIE:
Great.

MIKE:
I never complain.

STEPHANIE:
Never.

MIKE:
No.
So, um, you're here in Chicago.

STEPHANIE:
Yeah.

MIKE:
What hotel are you staying at?
