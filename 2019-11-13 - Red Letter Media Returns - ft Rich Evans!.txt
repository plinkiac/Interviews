MACAULAY:
Hey, everybody.
This is the BunnyEars podcast.
I am your host, Steve Urkel.
I'm gonna be Steve Urkel this week.
Uh, we have some returning guests.
Uh, it's the the boys from Red Letter Media.
We have, uh, Mike Stoklasa, that we found it was a family name.

MIKE:
Yes, we talked to all about.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, Jay Bauman.

JAY:
Hello.

MACAULAY:
Hey.

MACAULAY:
Rich Evans.

RICH:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
Rich Evans.

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Isn't everyone's name a family name?

MACAULAY:
Well, you never know, you know?
I just thought you maybe picked that as, like, a stage name.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
That's true.

MACAULAY:
You know, just something nice and simple.
"Stoklasa".

MIKE:
Easy to pronounce.

MACAULAY:
So, um, I guess we should start with...
Bum...
Bum...
Bum...

JAY:
Oh, goddammit.

MACAULAY:
Bum...
Bum...

MIKE:
Dah-dah-doo-doo-doo...
Bennie!
Bennie!

SHAWN:
Bennie and the Jets!

MIKE:
Yes.
Bennie and the Jets.

JAY:
A song that will plague the rest of our lives.

RICH:
Just yours, Jay.

JAY:
Just mine?

RICH:
Yeah.
I can deal with it.
I can, I can deal.

JAY:
Don't you get annoyed just when any song is stuck in your head for enough period of time?

RICH:
Not if I like it.
Not, not if I like it.

MIKE:
Good answer.

MACAULAY:
Do you, do you like Bennie and the Jets?

JAY:
Seriously?
You will never ever get tired of Bennie and the Jets?

RICH:
It's fine.
You know what, that song is probably not going to get stuck in my head.
It hasn't been.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
You, you guys were singing it yesterday.
Well, not you, Jay.
Mac and Mike were just all day yesterday,
"Bennie!"
"Bennie and..."
And I went home.
I was just fine.

JAY:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
I know, it...

JAY:
I'm envious.

MACAULAY:
It's gone on for a couple of days now.
Just, yeah, Mike will just start singing Bennie and the Jets.
And it gets stuck for the rest of the day.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Rich, what about "Energy and me"?

MIKE:
"I use it every day."

RICH:
It vanished.
It completely vanished.

JAY:
Oh.
I wish I had that ability to just let songs leave my brain like that.

MIKE:
I had another song that these guys have never heard of.
It's "Let 'Em In".
Wings and Paul McCartney.

MACAULAY:
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
"Open the door."

MIKE:
"Open the door and let 'em in."
I think it's a similar kind of, like, overly-repetitious nightmare song that burrows its way in your brain.
Won't leave.

JAY:
Glad I don't know it.

MACAULAY:
So, uh, burning question from, uh, your last episode.
Do pumpkins grow in Florida?

MIKE:
Well, uh, someone just tweeted a picture at us of a pumpkin truck coming from Canada all the way to Florida to deliver pumpkins.
Um, we don't have a solid answer on that.

MACAULAY:
Okay.
So you're not sure?
It's just, it's just one photo.
But it's on Twitter, so...

RICH:
For the record, we weren't saying they don't have pumpkins in Florida.

MIKE:
Yes.
I said "do they grow"?

RICH:
Trucks exist.

MIKE:
And stores exist.
And they bring them there.
And people in Florida have pumpkins on Halloween.
But do they...
Is there a place where they grow?

JAY:
I think we got multiple...
Like, some people said,
"I live in Florida, and they do grow here."
And then other people saying,
"I live in Florida, and they definitely don't grow here."

MIKE:
Yes.
We got conflicting...

JAY:
So even people in Florida don't know.

MACAULAY:
So there you go.
So I, I...
That's settled?

JAY:
The, the answer is "maybe"?

MACAULAY:
They definitely do get ones from Canada at some point.
But that, you know...

JAY:
Pump-...
You can get pumpkins in the state of Florida.

MACAULAY:
Okay.

JAY:
That's, that's the ultimate takeaway.

RICH:
Confirmed.

JAY:
Confirmed.

MACAULAY:
Burning question.

JAY:
It's not like you go down there asking for a pumpkin and they look at you like you're speaking a foreign language.
They are aware of pumpkins.

MIKE:
We, we can get avocados in Wisconsin, you know?

JAY:
That's true.

MIKE:
It's a magical world we live in.
But, but, uh...

RICH:
World of trucks.

MIKE:
World filled with trucks.
And carrying vegetables with E. coli.
Oh, what a country.

MACAULAY:
So, uh, um...
So earlier, you know...
Last episode, we, we established that you firmly believe in ghosts, right?

MIKE:
Uh, uh-huh.

MACAULAY:
Firmly, right?

MIKE:
I'm an open-minded skeptic.

MACAULAY:
Do you think this, this studio is haunted?

MIKE:
No.

MACAULAY:
No?

MIKE:
No.

MACAULAY:
Do, do you want, do you want to find out whether or not it's haunted?

MIKE:
Uh, sure.

MACAULAY:
Because I got you a gift.
Because last time I was here, I got Jay the, uh, the Warriors vest.

MIKE:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
So, I got you...

MIKE:
Oh, my god!

MACAULAY:
A spirit box.

MIKE:
A spirit box?

MACAULAY:
Yes, it is.

MIKE:
Oh!
That's so awesome.

RICH:
You knew, you knew what that was instantly.

MACAULAY:
It's an external speaker, too.

MIKE:
I did.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
It's an, it's an SB7.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, this is great.

JAY:
Do they use that on Ghost Adventures, Mike?

MIKE:
They, they do.
Not this particular model.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
But, uh...

RICH:
You should see the smile on Mike's face when he got that box.

MIKE:
So, a spirit box cycles through radio frequencies at a very fast rate.
They even have newer ones that...

RICH:
I am aware of the pseudo-science.

MIKE:
Okay.
Um...

JAY:
You're aware of the mumbo-jumbo.

RICH:
Okay.
We should explain it anyway, because I'm sure there's many who don't...

MIKE:
Well, okay.
It goes tch-tch-tch-tch-tch...
Like, it cycles through radio frequencies.
Um, and so you think,
"Well, radio?"
"You're gonna pick up a voice, right?"
But, uh, uh, a voice or a sentence sometimes multiple words will come through, and it's like, you know,
"How did that..."
It's like taking, uh...

RICH:
Because radio stations have words.

MIKE:
No.
That's my point, is that it's like you have a million puzzles, and you pull a piece from each puzzle, and you put 'em all together, and it makes, makes a picture somehow.
You know, that's how it goes.
A voice...

MACAULAY:
Well, no.
It makes a picture because it's designed to do that?

MIKE:
Well, well...

RICH:
How do...
How do the ghosts do this?

MIKE:
I don't know, Rich.
I'm not an expert.

RICH:
If a ghost is capable of assembling full sentences out of random strings of radio data floating through the air...

MIKE:
Because it's using its, it's using its energy to, to get into the electronic device and talk through it.

JAY:
They've got nothing but time.

MACAULAY:
You sound really bored.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So the odds of a sentence or a bunch of words coming out from, from, say, 100 radio broadcasts that all come in together and making, you know,
"Hi, it's me."
"I'm dead."
You know, the odds of that are astronomical.
So that's kind of how a spirit box works.

MACAULAY:
Well, I cracked it open earlier to make sure it works.
And it does.
And you can adjust how fast it cycles through and everything.

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
This is so exciting.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, it's...
The power's on the bottom right corner.

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh, I see it.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, you gotta hold it down for a couple seconds.

JAY:
Looks like a tiny portable radio.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

SPIRIT BOX:
Can I have alcohol?
Definitely.

JAY:
Is that a ghost?
Are we hearing ghosts?

MIKE:
No.
It's not sweeping yet.

MACAULAY:
So what you, what you do is you hold down...
Here, I'll show you.

MIKE:
I turned it on.

RICH:
I thought the ghost wanted alcohol.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, you hold down the sweep?

MACAULAY:
Uh, yes.
So what you do is, uh...

JAY:
They came to the right building.

MACAULAY:
You figure out what rate you want.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
So there's like, right now it'll go fast.
What you do is, you go forward.
And you hold that down.

MIKE:
Okay.

MACAULAY:
And it'll just start cycling.

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
We have to do a ghost thing now.

JAY:
Oh, sure.
Yeah, we'll do a ghost adventure.

MIKE:
Oh, is this to...

MACAULAY:
Yeah, it turns up the volume.
Apparently, it's supposed to.

MIKE:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
I gotta turn it up.
I gotta start, gotta turn it on.

MIKE:
Yes.
Okay.

MACAULAY:
And you can adjust the speed.

JAY:
Ah!

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MACAULAY:
And you can do AM, you can do AM or FM, too.
So, you wanna, you wanna ask, uh, a ghost a question?

MIKE:
That's it.

JAY:
I jsut heard a ghost.
I heard one.

MIKE:
Is there...
Is there a spirit here with us at the Red Letter Media studios?

RICH:
No...

JAY:
That sounded like Mr. Plinkett.

SHAWN:	
He's saying E-R-T...

MIKE:
Oh!

SHAWN:
Tickle...

JAY:
Wouldn't it be crazy if it stopped on a station that was playing Bennie and the Jets?
That would make me a believer in ghosts if that happened.

SPIRIT BOX:
Five hospitals.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

SPIRIT BOX:
And medical centers.

MIKE:
Oh, god.
Hold on.
Oh.

RICH:
We can't stop it, folks.

JAY:
Oh, god.

MACAULAY:
It's a poltergeist.

MIKE:
Okay.
Now it's sweeping.
Oh, you can reverse sweep.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
I knew you were gonna have a ball with this thing.

MIKE:
There we go.
Tell us your name, ghost.
What is your name?

RICH:
"Herb'.
It said "Herb".

JAY:
Is it Wyatt Earp?

MIKE:
It's Wyatt Earp?

JAY:
Oh, my god.
Our studio is haunted by Wyatt Earp.

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.
Wyatt Earp.
What do we ask Wyatt Earp?

MIKE:
Wyatt Earp, how are you...
How is your ghost in Milwaukee?

RICH:
"Walked here."

MIKE:
"Walked here."

RICH:
It said "walked here".

JAY:
Oh, my god.

RICH:
The ghost of Wyatt Earp walked here.

MACAULAY:
From Tombstone, yeah.

RICH:
Wyatt.
Why did you walk here to our studio?
"Smoothies"?
Did it say "smoothies"?

SHAWN:
"Beer".
"Good beer".

JAY:
That makes sense.

MACAULAY:
That makes perfect sense, yeah.

MIKE:
This is amazing.
Thank you, Mac.

MACAULAY:
You got it.
Yeah, yeah.
I figured you'd have a ball with that thing.

MIKE:
This, we'll, we're gonna take this when we do our ghost hunt.

MACAULAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And that's one of our, our upcoming videos.
We'll announce it now.
We have to figure out where we're gonna go.

RICH:
Sure, sure.

MACAULAY:
Now you've got all of the equipment.

MIKE:
My number one place would be the, um...
It has its own little built-in light.
Look at that.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.
It's a little switch there for on and off.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

MACAULAY:
And also this, that's, this is how you charge it.

MIKE:
Oh, okay.
Um, I would love to visit the Villisca Axe Murder House in Iowa.
It's about, it's about eight hours drive.
Eight-hour drive.

RICH:
That's fine.
It's fine.
For a very special episode?

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's one of the most haunted locations in Iowa.

MACAULAY:
So a 16-hour roundtrip for about, like, what, three hours of, uh, of, uh...

MIKE:
Well, you can, you can rent it overnight.

MACAULAY:
Oh, really?

MIKE:
Um, and, and it books up, like, a year in advance.
Uh, obviously for October.
Then after that, it's kinda easy to get there because there's no...
I don't think there's power or heat.
So, yeah.
You gotta be hardy, uh, and, uh, really into ghost-hunting to stay there overnight.
Since there's no bathrooms or heat.

MACAULAY:
Why, why is it haunted?
Like, is it...
What's the backstory?

RICH:
It's called the Axe Murder House.

JAY:
That's an unrelated name, though.

MIKE:
That's what they called the house when they built it.

MACAULAY:
So, so someone got shot, right?

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.
Well, uh...
So, there was a family there.
Uh, a mother, father...
I think they had four kids.
And then there were two unrelated kids sleeping over.
They all went to church.
They all went to the house at night.
And they had a sleepover.
And then in the middle of the night, uh, someone went around and methodically killed everyone in the house with an axe.

MACAULAY:
And they thought he was living in the attic the whole time.

MIKE:
They thought he was hiding in the attic during the day to, to come out at night.
And they never caught him.

MACAULAY:
And he stayed there for a couple of days, like, afterward even.
Like, he ate their food, and things like that.

MIKE:
I...
Oh.
Uh, yeah.
I don't...
I didn't know, hear that.
But, um...
Uh, so they thought they caught the guy, and they're like,
"Yeah, this is probably the guy."
You know, it was 1912, I believe?
Um, and he's like,
"I didn't do it."
It was, like, this drifter guy.
And they really didn't know who did it.
Um, but there's a lot of, a lot of haunted stuff that goes on there.

MACAULAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Um, the Ghost Adventures went there, and, uh...

MACAULAY:
Is that, is that the Bilbo Baggins one?

MIKE:
Uh, what?

MACAULAY:
The host.
Bilbo Baggins.

MIKE:
Oh.
Zak Bagans.

MACAULAY:
Oh, okay.

MIKE:
Yes, related to Bilbo.

JAY:
Is that the episode where he has the axe hanging above, above him?

MIKE:
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!

JAY:
And he's like,
"Come at me, bro!"

MIKE:
He lays down, and he has an axe precariously placed above his head.
And he's like, he's like, he's like,
"Push that axe on my face, bro!"

JAY:
"I dare you, ghost!"

MIKE:
Um, but they have, they have a really good, like, lockdown camera in the, the baby's room upstairs where the, the door just kind of slams closed, violently.
