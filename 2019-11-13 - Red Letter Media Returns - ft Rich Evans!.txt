MACAULAY:
Hey, everybody.
This is the BunnyEars podcast.
I am your host, Steve Urkel.
I'm gonna be Steve Urkel this week.
Uh, we have some returning guests.
Uh, it's the the boys from Red Letter Media.
We have, uh, Mike Stoklasa, that we found it was a family name.

MIKE:
Yes, we talked to all about.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, Jay Bauman.

JAY:
Hello.

MACAULAY:
Hey.

MACAULAY:
Rich Evans.

RICH:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
Rich Evans.

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Isn't everyone's name a family name?

MACAULAY:
Well, you never know, you know?
I just thought you maybe picked that as, like, a stage name.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
That's true.

MACAULAY:
You know, just something nice and simple.
"Stoklasa".

MIKE:
Easy to pronounce.

MACAULAY:
So, um, I guess we should start with...
Bum...
Bum...
Bum...

JAY:
Oh, goddammit.

MACAULAY:
Bum...
Bum...

MIKE:
Dah-dah-doo-doo-doo...
Bennie!
Bennie!

SHAWN:
Bennie and the Jets!

MIKE:
Yes.
Bennie and the Jets.

JAY:
A song that will plague the rest of our lives.

RICH:
Just yours, Jay.

JAY:
Just mine?

RICH:
Yeah.
I can deal with it.
I can, I can deal.

JAY:
Don't you get annoyed just when any song is stuck in your head for enough period of time?

RICH:
Not if I like it.
Not, not if I like it.

MIKE:
Good answer.

MACAULAY:
Do you, do you like Bennie and the Jets?

JAY:
Seriously?
You will never ever get tired of Bennie and the Jets?

RICH:
It's fine.
You know what, that song is probably not going to get stuck in my head.
It hasn't been.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
You, you guys were singing it yesterday.
Well, not you, Jay.
Mac and Mike were just all day yesterday,
"Bennie!"
"Bennie and..."
And I went home.
I was just fine.

JAY:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
I know, it...

JAY:
I'm envious.

MACAULAY:
It's gone on for a couple of days now.
Just, yeah, Mike will just start singing Bennie and the Jets.
And it gets stuck for the rest of the day.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Rich, what about "Energy and me"?

MIKE:
"I use it every day."

RICH:
It vanished.
It completely vanished.

JAY:
Oh.
I wish I had that ability to just let songs leave my brain like that.

MIKE:
I had another song that these guys have never heard of.
It's "Let 'Em In".
Wings and Paul McCartney.

MACAULAY:
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
"Open the door."

MIKE:
"Open the door and let 'em in."
I think it's a similar kind of, like, overly-repetitious nightmare song that burrows its way in your brain.
Won't leave.

JAY:
Glad I don't know it.

MACAULAY:
So, uh, burning question from, uh, your last episode.
Do pumpkins grow in Florida?

MIKE:
Well, uh, someone just tweeted a picture at us of a pumpkin truck coming from Canada all the way to Florida to deliver pumpkins.
Um, we don't have a solid answer on that.

MACAULAY:
Okay.
So you're not sure?
It's just, it's just one photo.
But it's on Twitter, so...

RICH:
For the record, we weren't saying they don't have pumpkins in Florida.

MIKE:
Yes.
I said "do they grow"?

RICH:
Trucks exist.

MIKE:
And stores exist.
And they bring them there.
And people in Florida have pumpkins on Halloween.
But do they...
Is there a place where they grow?

JAY:
I think we got multiple...
Like, some people said,
"I live in Florida, and they do grow here."
And then other people saying,
"I live in Florida, and they definitely don't grow here."

MIKE:
Yes.
We got conflicting...

JAY:
So even people in Florida don't know.

MACAULAY:
So there you go.
So I, I...
That's settled?

JAY:
The, the answer is "maybe"?

MACAULAY:
They definitely do get ones from Canada at some point.
But that, you know...

JAY:
Pump-...
You can get pumpkins in the state of Florida.

MACAULAY:
Okay.

JAY:
That's, that's the ultimate takeaway.

RICH:
Confirmed.

JAY:
Confirmed.

MACAULAY:
Burning question.

JAY:
It's not like you go down there asking for a pumpkin and they look at you like you're speaking a foreign language.
They are aware of pumpkins.

MIKE:
We, we can get avocados in Wisconsin, you know?

JAY:
That's true.

MIKE:
It's a magical world we live in.
But, but, uh...

RICH:
World of trucks.

MIKE:
World filled with trucks.
And carrying vegetables with E. coli.
Oh, what a country.

MACAULAY:
So, uh, um...
So earlier, you know...
Last episode, we, we established that you firmly believe in ghosts, right?

MIKE:
Uh, uh-huh.

MACAULAY:
Firmly, right?

MIKE:
I'm an open-minded skeptic.

MACAULAY:
Do you think this, this studio is haunted?

MIKE:
No.

MACAULAY:
No?

MIKE:
No.

MACAULAY:
Do, do you want, do you want to find out whether or not it's haunted?

MIKE:
Uh, sure.

MACAULAY:
Because I got you a gift.
Because last time I was here, I got Jay the, uh, the Warriors vest.

MIKE:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
So, I got you...

MIKE:
Oh, my god!

MACAULAY:
A spirit box.

MIKE:
A spirit box?

MACAULAY:
Yes, it is.

MIKE:
Oh!
That's so awesome.

RICH:
You knew, you knew what that was instantly.

MACAULAY:
It's an external speaker, too.

MIKE:
I did.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
It's an, it's an SB7.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, this is great.

JAY:
Do they use that on Ghost Adventures, Mike?

MIKE:
They, they do.
Not this particular model.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
But, uh...

RICH:
You should see the smile on Mike's face when he got that box.

MIKE:
So, a spirit box cycles through radio frequencies at a very fast rate.
They even have newer ones that...

RICH:
I am aware of the pseudo-science.

MIKE:
Okay.
Um...

JAY:
You're aware of the mumbo-jumbo.

RICH:
Okay.
We should explain it anyway, because I'm sure there's many who don't...

MIKE:
Well, okay.
It goes tch-tch-tch-tch-tch...
Like, it cycles through radio frequencies.
Um, and so you think,
"Well, radio?"
"You're gonna pick up a voice, right?"
But, uh, uh, a voice or a sentence sometimes multiple words will come through, and it's like, you know,
"How did that..."
It's like taking, uh...

RICH:
Because radio stations have words.

MIKE:
No.
That's my point, is that it's like you have a million puzzles, and you pull a piece from each puzzle, and you put 'em all together, and it makes, makes a picture somehow.
You know, that's how it goes.
A voice...

MACAULAY:
Well, no.
It makes a picture because it's designed to do that?

MIKE:
Well, well...

RICH:
How do...
How do the ghosts do this?

MIKE:
I don't know, Rich.
I'm not an expert.

RICH:
If a ghost is capable of assembling full sentences out of random strings of radio data floating through the air...

MIKE:
Because it's using its, it's using its energy to, to get into the electronic device and talk through it.

JAY:
They've got nothing but time.

MACAULAY:
You sound really bored.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So the odds of a sentence or a bunch of words coming out from, from, say, 100 radio broadcasts that all come in together and making, you know,
"Hi, it's me."
"I'm dead."
You know, the odds of that are astronomical.
So that's kind of how a spirit box works.

MACAULAY:
Well, I cracked it open earlier to make sure it works.
And it does.
And you can adjust how fast it cycles through and everything.

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
This is so exciting.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, it's...
The power's on the bottom right corner.

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh, I see it.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, you gotta hold it down for a couple seconds.

JAY:
Looks like a tiny portable radio.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

SPIRIT BOX:
Can I have alcohol?
Definitely.

JAY:
Is that a ghost?
Are we hearing ghosts?

MIKE:
No.
It's not sweeping yet.

MACAULAY:
So what you, what you do is you hold down...
Here, I'll show you.

MIKE:
I turned it on.

RICH:
I thought the ghost wanted alcohol.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, you hold down the sweep?

MACAULAY:
Uh, yes.
So what you do is, uh...

JAY:
They came to the right building.

MACAULAY:
You figure out what rate you want.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
So there's like, right now it'll go fast.
What you do is, you go forward.
And you hold that down.

MIKE:
Okay.

MACAULAY:
And it'll just start cycling.

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
We have to do a ghost thing now.

JAY:
Oh, sure.
Yeah, we'll do a ghost adventure.

MIKE:
Oh, is this to...

MACAULAY:
Yeah, it turns up the volume.
Apparently, it's supposed to.

MIKE:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
I gotta turn it up.
I gotta start, gotta turn it on.

MIKE:
Yes.
Okay.

MACAULAY:
And you can adjust the speed.

JAY:
Ah!

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MACAULAY:
And you can do AM, you can do AM or FM, too.
So, you wanna, you wanna ask, uh, a ghost a question?

MIKE:
That's it.

JAY:
I jsut heard a ghost.
I heard one.

MIKE:
Is there...
Is there a spirit here with us at the Red Letter Media studios?

RICH:
No...

JAY:
That sounded like Mr. Plinkett.

SHAWN:	
He's saying E-R-T...

MIKE:
Oh!

SHAWN:
Tickle...

JAY:
Wouldn't it be crazy if it stopped on a station that was playing Bennie and the Jets?
That would make me a believer in ghosts if that happened.

SPIRIT BOX:
Five hospitals.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

SPIRIT BOX:
And medical centers.

MIKE:
Oh, god.
Hold on.
Oh.

RICH:
We can't stop it, folks.

JAY:
Oh, god.

MACAULAY:
It's a poltergeist.

MIKE:
Okay.
Now it's sweeping.
Oh, you can reverse sweep.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
I knew you were gonna have a ball with this thing.

MIKE:
There we go.
Tell us your name, ghost.
What is your name?

RICH:
"Herb'.
It said "Herb".

JAY:
Is it Wyatt Earp?

MIKE:
It's Wyatt Earp?

JAY:
Oh, my god.
Our studio is haunted by Wyatt Earp.

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.
Wyatt Earp.
What do we ask Wyatt Earp?

MIKE:
Wyatt Earp, how are you...
How is your ghost in Milwaukee?

RICH:
"Walked here."

MIKE:
"Walked here."

RICH:
It said "walked here".

JAY:
Oh, my god.

RICH:
The ghost of Wyatt Earp walked here.

MACAULAY:
From Tombstone, yeah.

RICH:
Wyatt.
Why did you walk here to our studio?
"Smoothies"?
Did it say "smoothies"?

SHAWN:
"Beer".
"Good beer".

JAY:
That makes sense.

MACAULAY:
That makes perfect sense, yeah.

MIKE:
This is amazing.
Thank you, Mac.

MACAULAY:
You got it.
Yeah, yeah.
I figured you'd have a ball with that thing.

MIKE:
This, we'll, we're gonna take this when we do our ghost hunt.

MACAULAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And that's one of our, our upcoming videos.
We'll announce it now.
We have to figure out where we're gonna go.

RICH:
Sure, sure.

MACAULAY:
Now you've got all of the equipment.

MIKE:
My number one place would be the, um...
It has its own little built-in light.
Look at that.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.
It's a little switch there for on and off.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

MACAULAY:
And also this, that's, this is how you charge it.

MIKE:
Oh, okay.
Um, I would love to visit the Villisca Axe Murder House in Iowa.
It's about, it's about eight hours drive.
Eight-hour drive.

RICH:
That's fine.
It's fine.
For a very special episode?

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's one of the most haunted locations in Iowa.

MACAULAY:
So a 16-hour roundtrip for about, like, what, three hours of, uh, of, uh...

MIKE:
Well, you can, you can rent it overnight.

MACAULAY:
Oh, really?

MIKE:
Um, and, and it books up, like, a year in advance.
Uh, obviously for October.
Then after that, it's kinda easy to get there because there's no...
I don't think there's power or heat.
So, yeah.
You gotta be hardy, uh, and, uh, really into ghost-hunting to stay there overnight.
Since there's no bathrooms or heat.

MACAULAY:
Why, why is it haunted?
Like, is it...
What's the backstory?

RICH:
It's called the Axe Murder House.

JAY:
That's an unrelated name, though.

MIKE:
That's what they called the house when they built it.

MACAULAY:
So, so someone got shot, right?

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.
Well, uh...
So, there was a family there.
Uh, a mother, father...
I think they had four kids.
And then there were two unrelated kids sleeping over.
They all went to church.
They all went to the house at night.
And they had a sleepover.
And then in the middle of the night, uh, someone went around and methodically killed everyone in the house with an axe.

MACAULAY:
And they thought he was living in the attic the whole time.

MIKE:
They thought he was hiding in the attic during the day to, to come out at night.
And they never caught him.

MACAULAY:
And he stayed there for a couple of days, like, afterward even.
Like, he ate their food, and things like that.

MIKE:
I...
Oh.
Uh, yeah.
I don't...
I didn't know, hear that.
But, um...
Uh, so they thought they caught the guy, and they're like,
"Yeah, this is probably the guy."
You know, it was 1912, I believe?
Um, and he's like,
"I didn't do it."
It was, like, this drifter guy.
And they really didn't know who did it.
Um, but there's a lot of, a lot of haunted stuff that goes on there.

MACAULAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Um, the Ghost Adventures went there, and, uh...

MACAULAY:
Is that, is that the Bilbo Baggins one?

MIKE:
Uh, what?

MACAULAY:
The host.
Bilbo Baggins.

MIKE:
Oh.
Zak Bagans.

MACAULAY:
Oh, okay.

MIKE:
Yes, related to Bilbo.

JAY:
Is that the episode where he has the axe hanging above, above him?

MIKE:
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!

JAY:
And he's like,
"Come at me, bro!"

MIKE:
He lays down, and he has an axe precariously placed above his head.
And he's like, he's like, he's like,
"Push that axe on my face, bro!"

JAY:
"I dare you, ghost!"

MIKE:
Um, but they have, they have a really good, like, lockdown camera in the, the baby's room upstairs where the, the door just kind of slams closed, violently.
Whether it was faked or not, I don't know.
Um, and then I watched a different ghost...

JAY:
I wonder if the mic picked up our eyes rolling.

MACAULAY:
Rich's reaction.

JAY:
You could hear that sound.

MIKE:
You know, it's that Simpson squish sound effect.
Your eyes rolling up.
Uh, a different ghost-hunting show set up, like, uh, uh...
What is it, like, um...
Electromagnetic EMP field recorders, right?

RICH:
Uh-huh.

MIKE:
All over the house.
And then at the same time of night when the axe murderer, middle of the night, they got a spike of electromagnetic energy in the attic.
And then...

MACAULAY:
There's no electricity in the house.

MIKE:
Right.
Exactly.
Uh, and then a spike in the baby's room...

MACAULAY:
I'm following.

MIKE:
Is the same...
It followed the same path that the killer took.
All these spikes in electromagnetic...

MACAULAY:
Well, they don't know what path, really.

MIKE:
Well, they, uh, I think they did.

RICH:
Obviously it was the path the killer took.
It's the only thing that makes sense.

MIKE:
They, they, they, they...
He started in the baby's room.
And I think he killed the, uh, I think he killed parents first, obviously.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Um...

MACAULAY:
And didn't he get somebody in the barn, or something like that?
Except this one?

MIKE:
I don't know about the barn.
I think that might be something else.

MACAULAY:
All right.

MIKE:
But that's a cool location.
There's lots of cool locations.
Um...

MACAULAY:
So, but that's top in your list?

MIKE:
I, I think so.
That's the place that's the spookiest for me.

JAY:
Well, and it's realistic to get there.

MIKE:
It's realistic to get there.
There's, there's places here in Milwaukee, but they all suck.

JAY:
Some of them are bullshit.

MIKE:
Ghost Adventures didn't even come here for their serial killer episode.

JAY:
They didn't?

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
What about Bachelor's Grove Cemetary?

MIKE:
Bachelor's Grove Cemetary, yeah.
That's, uh, that's, uh, in, uh, down in Illinois.

RICH:
That was where, near where we came from.

JAY:
Oh, okay.

MACAULAY:
Where you, where you came out of the primordial ooze?

RICH:
Yes, yes.

MIKE:
Yes.
That, that...
Ghost Adventures went to Bachelor's Grove Cemetary.

RICH:
They did?
Huh.

MIKE:
And they caught the, the mysterious floating light in the, in the woods.
The whole area was surrounded by cops.
And nobody could get in there.
And then they found the gold, the floating lantern.
They couldn't explain.
Bachelor's Grove Cemetary has a lime pit.

MACAULAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
And it's this, this murky water that goes down very deep.
And it's rumored that the mob would dump bodies there.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Because Al Capone used to hang out there.

MACAULAY:
Because lime will help dissolve the bodies.

MIKE:
Uh, there's, there's supposedly a car at the bottom.
No one's gone down there.
So, that, that's, uh, adds to the haunting.
There'a restaurant called Jack Gibbons Gardens from the 30's around the corner.
Al Capone used to hang out there.
There's a lot of mob activity in Chicago-land area.
I could talk about this for a while, too.

MACAULAY:
Oh, yeah.

RICH:
I was involved.
Didn't you do, like, a cheesy video project on Bachelor's Grove?

MIKE:
I did.
I did.
Yeah.
Yes.
I, I won an award for it, actually.
I'm not kidding.
I did.

JAY:
One of those prestigious high school class awards?

MIKE:
I, I was, uh, uh, a film and video maker award.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
I did a little video piece about Bachelor's Grove and why it was haunted.
And I had a special effect in it.
I, I keyed in a, a float...
Because people say they see a house.

RICH:
Wait.
Did you fake ghost evidence?

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MACAULAY:
Never.

MIKE:
I clearly wrote "recreation" on the bottom.
Because I...
I filmed, like, a little house and I chroma-keyed it in and, like, made it half-opacity.
And it was like,
"Whoo-o-o!"

JAY:
Oh, okay.

MIKE:
Because people say they see a spooky house floating above the lake.
There's a lot of stories from there, too.

MACAULAY:
I just love your love of ghosts.
Or, ghost-hunters, rather.

MIKE:
I do enjoy it.
I do enjoy it.
I'm fascinated by it.

MACAULAY:
I can tell.

MIKE:
I just, I, you know, it's, you know, wanna have some kind of ghost experience some day.
And it's never happened.
And I think there's, there's, there's probably a reason.

MACAULAY:
"I just want it so bad!"

JAY:
For your sake, I hope it does happen.

MIKE:
Thank you, Jay.
Thank you.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.
I'm pulling for you.

MIKE:
Now, Rich.
You believe in flat Earth.

RICH:
Oh, of course.

MIKE:
Let's, uh, let's talk about that.

MACAULAY:
Let's talk about that, yeah.

SHAWN:
Hello, and welcome to Meditation Minute.
I am your guide, Louis Prada.
Think of me as your personal chef who ensures that you nightly sup upon the succulent flesh of serenity.
Some of my most attentive -- some say obnoxious -- listeners took to social media last week to let me know that my previous episode was not quite up to my normal editorial standards.
Turns out, in my haste to get the episode recorded and published, I made a few mistakes.
I feel like I've broken your trust, so I want to begin the healing process my issuing some corrections and retractions.
At around the 30-second mark of the episode, I misspoke when I said that a global cabal of the super-rich are planning to flee the devestating effects of climate change by seeking refuge on a moon colony.
What I meant to say was...breathe in.
I have never been a world champion at anything, let alone meditation.
As far as I know, no such designation even exists.
And, if it did, I would be staunchly against it.
Self-care is not a competition.
But just know that if it was, I would be the champion of it.
I would like to clarify that while the mind's eye is definitely a real concept, a mind's pink eye is not.
But it's probably a good idea to keep fecal particles away from it all the same.
To the listeners I offended when I called them out by name and said offensive things about them, I am sorry...for not including your home addresses and social security numbers, you fucking assholes.
You know who you are.
Because I called you out.
By name.
At the 1-minute and 18-second mark, I claimed that without enough meditation, you'll be able to levitate objects with your mind.
What I meant to say, is that you could pick them up with your hands and look at them and then put them back down.
It's not so much psychokinesis as it is just basic human dexterity.
Finally, I didn't meant to imply that meditation was a scam.
It's a definitive fact.
I hope that cleared the air so we can now move to find the serenity you seek.
My name is Louis Prada, and this has been Meditation Minute.
Namaste.

RICH:
No, I don't.

MACAULAY:
I know.
I'm actually fascinated with the flat-Earth, like, people.
Like, I, I, I'm constantly...
Like, almost, I'd say about three times a week, I, I, I type into YouTube...

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, "flat-Earth" something.

RICH:
I went through a phase where I was fascinated by them.
I think I'm over it now.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
I'm, I'm over flat-Earthers.

JAY:
Well, they probably only have a limited amount talking points, right?

MACAULAY:
Arguments to be made, yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
I would think.

RICH:
The weird thing is, I, the, the conspiracy.
Like, there's no motivation for there to be a conspiracy to cover the globe up.

MACAULAY:
That's...
Every single one, you try to figure, it's like,
"But why?"

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
Why?

RICH:
"They don't want you to know about the globe!"

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Why?

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
But why?
"Because science grant money!"

MACAULAY:
NASA and stuff.

RICH:
They can also, they can also make grant money studying a flat Earth.
So, I mean...

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Like, to what end?
Well, also, every, like, airline pilot in the world would have to be in on it.

RICH:
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

MACAULAY:
Because otherwise it wouldn't make any...
And, look, my, my stepfather is a pilot.
And, uh, he can't keep his mouth shut.
And, he's, uh, he, he likes to drink hard, and all that kind of stuff.
And it's, like, there's no fucking way that, like, he could keep a secret like that.

JAY:
Some Christmas, he's gonna have a little too much and expose the truth.

MACAULAY:
That's what I'm saying.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
So, you know...
Like, I'm pretty sure, you know, Mark can't, can't keep that secret.
So, um, uh, uh...
Mike and Rich actually kind of came up with an idea for a movie...

MIKE:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
Yesterday.

MIKE:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
The Uncanny Valley.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
Well, well, in the news lately...
We should set this up.
There's, uh, uh, a new World War II movie...

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Starring James fucking Dean.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Well, it's not, it's not out yet.

RICH:
No.

MIKE:
It's in, it's in, it was announced.

MACAULAY:
It was just announced, yeah.

JAY:
They got...
They had to get attention for their sleazy project, so they announced it.
Yeah.
"We looked at hundreds of actors."
"The only one we could find for the part was James Dean."
"Who's not the right actor for any part because he's fucking dead."

MACAULAY:
He's dead-dead.

MIKE:
Yes.
Who's making this film?

JAY:
I, I had never even heard of the filmmaker.

MACAULAY:
Sam...

JAY:
I think that's why they did this...

MIKE:
A gimmick?

JAY:
Just to get attention for their, their dumb movie.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, and I doubt they're gonna follow through with it.
Like, how much backlash...

JAY:
It's gotten a lot of back...
Well, and it's so sleazy.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
If they were at least honest about it, where they're just like,
"Yeah, we're doing a gimmick."
Like, I would at least respect that a little bit...

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
Even though it's still weird.
But the fact that they're trying to say,
"He's the best actor for the role!"
He's not an actor.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
He's a computer...
You're making an animated character, basically.

MACAULAY:
He only did three movies, anyway.
Small sample size.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But an actor makes choices.
And a CG creation can't make choices.
So he's not an actor.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.
Tou-, touche.

JAY:
Or, or they cast somebody, and that person acts out the role, and they put James Dean's face on him.
In which case, that's not James Dean acting.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
We were saying that they'd probably have to list, like, three credits for James Dean's character.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
It would be James Dean.
It would be the body actor.
And then the voice actor.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Yeah.
And then the CGI artist.

MACAULAY:
Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
The wall of CGI artists.

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
The 500 people that are bringing James Dean to life that will never get credit for it.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.
So, uh, The Uncanny Valley.
Uh, do you guys, do you guys...
Pitch it.
Pitch it.

RICH:
We heard about this, and, uh, we had an idea that, let's just make a movie starring nothing but dead actors.

MIKE:
Yes.

RICH:
And, and...

JAY:
Dead celebrities.

RICH:
Dead celebrities.

JAY:
In general, yeah.

RICH:
And we'll, we'll call it The Uncanny Valley.

MIKE:
Yes.
And The Uncanny Valley is a, a futuristic theme park that you go to.
And I guess there's holo-projectors like Star Trek, right?

RICH:
Uh-huh.

MIKE:
Um, and they project holograms of your favorite dead celebrities for you to hang out with, you know?
Go swimming in the pool...

MACAULAY:
Marilyn Monroe.

MIKE:
With Marilyn Monroe.

MACAULAY:
Elvis Presley.

MIKE:
Yes.
Go see a concert by the, the Rat Pack...whatever.
I don't know.
Um, and, uh, and they can look...
The CGI doesn't have to be perfect, right?
Because...

MACAULAY:
It's the uncanny valley.

MIKE:
It makes sense in context of the movie.
It could be really good.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But, you know, I...
That's why I don't think they can pull off the James Dean thing 100%.

RICH:
Oh, of course not.

MIKE:
I mean, five seconds...

RICH:
Well, they'll get, they'll get...
Even if they can't now, they'll get there.

MIKE:
Well, yeah.
I know.
Yeah, maybe.

RICH:
We'll get a, we'll get across the uncanny valley, and then...

MIKE:
And then...

MACAULAY:
You know, they were kind of close with Peter Cushing.
But then, uh, but then Carrie Fisher was, was...

MIKE:
Ooh.

JAY:
Well, then Peter Cushing talked.

MIKE:
Peter Cushing...
Yes.

JAY:
They look great when they're just still.
When it's just their face.
But when they start talking, that's where you really notice...

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Like, something's off about the mouth, and...

RICH:
I don't even think Peter Cushing in, in Rogue One was that great.
It was really off-putting to me.

MI.KE:
No.
Yeah.
It was...

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Me, too.
I don't...
It was a little, little too uncanny valley.
Like, it really was.

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, a little close, but not enough that it became this irking, you know, for some.

MIKE:
It looked like a cartoon.
Yeah, and that was, like, I don't know, probably 30 seconds of footage of him.
