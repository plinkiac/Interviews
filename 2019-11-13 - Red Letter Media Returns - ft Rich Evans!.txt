MACAULAY:
Hey, everybody.
This is the BunnyEars podcast.
I am your host, Steve Urkel.
I'm gonna be Steve Urkel this week.
Uh, we have some returning guests.
Uh, it's the the boys from Red Letter Media.
We have, uh, Mike Stoklasa, that we found it was a family name.

MIKE:
Yes, we talked to all about.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, Jay Bauman.

JAY:
Hello.

MACAULAY:
Hey.

MACAULAY:
Rich Evans.

RICH:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
Rich Evans.

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Isn't everyone's name a family name?

MACAULAY:
Well, you never know, you know?
I just thought you maybe picked that as, like, a stage name.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
That's true.

MACAULAY:
You know, just something nice and simple.
"Stoklasa".

MIKE:
Easy to pronounce.

MACAULAY:
So, um, I guess we should start with...
Bum...
Bum...
Bum...

JAY:
Oh, goddammit.

MACAULAY:
Bum...
Bum...

MIKE:
Dah-dah-doo-doo-doo...
Bennie!
Bennie!

SHAWN:
Bennie and the Jets!

MIKE:
Yes.
Bennie and the Jets.

JAY:
A song that will plague the rest of our lives.

RICH:
Just yours, Jay.

JAY:
Just mine?

RICH:
Yeah.
I can deal with it.
I can, I can deal.

JAY:
Don't you get annoyed just when any song is stuck in your head for enough period of time?

RICH:
Not if I like it.
Not, not if I like it.

MIKE:
Good answer.

MACAULAY:
Do you, do you like Bennie and the Jets?

JAY:
Seriously?
You will never ever get tired of Bennie and the Jets?

RICH:
It's fine.
You know what, that song is probably not going to get stuck in my head.
It hasn't been.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
You, you guys were singing it yesterday.
Well, not you, Jay.
Mac and Mike were just all day yesterday,
"Bennie!"
"Bennie and..."
And I went home.
I was just fine.

JAY:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
I know, it...

JAY:
I'm envious.

MACAULAY:
It's gone on for a couple of days now.
Just, yeah, Mike will just start singing Bennie and the Jets.
And it gets stuck for the rest of the day.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
Rich, what about "Energy and me"?

MIKE:
"I use it every day."

RICH:
It vanished.
It completely vanished.

JAY:
Oh.
I wish I had that ability to just let songs leave my brain like that.

MIKE:
I had another song that these guys have never heard of.
It's "Let 'Em In".
Wings and Paul McCartney.

MACAULAY:
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
"Open the door."

MIKE:
"Open the door and let 'em in."
I think it's a similar kind of, like, overly-repetitious nightmare song that burrows its way in your brain.
Won't leave.

JAY:
Glad I don't know it.

MACAULAY:
So, uh, burning question from, uh, your last episode.
Do pumpkins grow in Florida?

MIKE:
Well, uh, someone just tweeted a picture at us of a pumpkin truck coming from Canada all the way to Florida to deliver pumpkins.
Um, we don't have a solid answer on that.

MACAULAY:
Okay.
So you're not sure?
It's just, it's just one photo.
But it's on Twitter, so...

RICH:
For the record, we weren't saying they don't have pumpkins in Florida.

MIKE:
Yes.
I said "do they grow"?

RICH:
Trucks exist.

MIKE:
And stores exist.
And they bring them there.
And people in Florida have pumpkins on Halloween.
But do they...
Is there a place where they grow?

JAY:
I think we got multiple...
Like, some people said,
"I live in Florida, and they do grow here."
And then other people saying,
"I live in Florida, and they definitely don't grow here."

MIKE:
Yes.
We got conflicting...

JAY:
So even people in Florida don't know.

MACAULAY:
So there you go.
So I, I...
That's settled?

JAY:
The, the answer is "maybe"?

MACAULAY:
They definitely do get ones from Canada at some point.
But that, you know...

JAY:
Pump-...
You can get pumpkins in the state of Florida.

MACAULAY:
Okay.

JAY:
That's, that's the ultimate takeaway.

RICH:
Confirmed.

JAY:
Confirmed.

MACAULAY:
Burning question.

JAY:
It's not like you go down there asking for a pumpkin and they look at you like you're speaking a foreign language.
They are aware of pumpkins.

MIKE:
We, we can get avocados in Wisconsin, you know?

JAY:
That's true.

MIKE:
It's a magical world we live in.
But, but, uh...

RICH:
World of trucks.

MIKE:
World filled with trucks.
And carrying vegetables with E. coli.
Oh, what a country.

MACAULAY:
So, uh, um...
So earlier, you know...
Last episode, we, we established that you firmly believe in ghosts, right?

MIKE:
Uh, uh-huh.

MACAULAY:
Firmly, right?

MIKE:
I'm an open-minded skeptic.

MACAULAY:
Do you think this, this studio is haunted?

MIKE:
No.

MACAULAY:
No?

MIKE:
No.

MACAULAY:
Do, do you want, do you want to find out whether or not it's haunted?

MIKE:
Uh, sure.

MACAULAY:
Because I got you a gift.
Because last time I was here, I got Jay the, uh, the Warriors vest.

MIKE:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
So, I got you...

MIKE:
Oh, my god!

MACAULAY:
A spirit box.

MIKE:
A spirit box?

MACAULAY:
Yes, it is.

MIKE:
Oh!
That's so awesome.

RICH:
You knew, you knew what that was instantly.

MACAULAY:
It's an external speaker, too.

MIKE:
I did.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
It's an, it's an SB7.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, this is great.

JAY:
Do they use that on Ghost Adventures, Mike?

MIKE:
They, they do.
Not this particular model.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
But, uh...

RICH:
You should see the smile on Mike's face when he got that box.

MIKE:
So, a spirit box cycles through radio frequencies at a very fast rate.
They even have newer ones that...

RICH:
I am aware of the pseudo-science.

MIKE:
Okay.
Um...

JAY:
You're aware of the mumbo-jumbo.

RICH:
Okay.
We should explain it anyway, because I'm sure there's many who don't...

MIKE:
Well, okay.
It goes tch-tch-tch-tch-tch...
Like, it cycles through radio frequencies.
Um, and so you think,
"Well, radio?"
"You're gonna pick up a voice, right?"
But, uh, uh, a voice or a sentence sometimes multiple words will come through, and it's like, you know,
"How did that..."
It's like taking, uh...

RICH:
Because radio stations have words.

MIKE:
No.
That's my point, is that it's like you have a million puzzles, and you pull a piece from each puzzle, and you put 'em all together, and it makes, makes a picture somehow.
You know, that's how it goes.
A voice...

MACAULAY:
Well, no.
It makes a picture because it's designed to do that?

MIKE:
Well, well...

RICH:
How do...
How do the ghosts do this?

MIKE:
I don't know, Rich.
I'm not an expert.

RICH:
If a ghost is capable of assembling full sentences out of random strings of radio data floating through the air...

MIKE:
Because it's using its, it's using its energy to, to get into the electronic device and talk through it.

JAY:
They've got nothing but time.

MACAULAY:
You sound really bored.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So the odds of a sentence or a bunch of words coming out from, from, say, 100 radio broadcasts that all come in together and making, you know,
"Hi, it's me."
"I'm dead."
You know, the odds of that are astronomical.
So that's kind of how a spirit box works.

MACAULAY:
Well, I cracked it open earlier to make sure it works.
And it does.
And you can adjust how fast it cycles through and everything.

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
This is so exciting.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, it's...
The power's on the bottom right corner.

MIKE:
Oh.
Oh, I see it.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, you gotta hold it down for a couple seconds.

JAY:
Looks like a tiny portable radio.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

SPIRIT BOX:
Can I have alcohol?
Definitely.

JAY:
Is that a ghost?
Are we hearing ghosts?

MIKE:
No.
It's not sweeping yet.

MACAULAY:
So what you, what you do is you hold down...
Here, I'll show you.

MIKE:
I turned it on.

RICH:
I thought the ghost wanted alcohol.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, you hold down the sweep?

MACAULAY:
Uh, yes.
So what you do is, uh...

JAY:
They came to the right building.

MACAULAY:
You figure out what rate you want.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
So there's like, right now it'll go fast.
What you do is, you go forward.
And you hold that down.

MIKE:
Okay.

MACAULAY:
And it'll just start cycling.

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
We have to do a ghost thing now.

JAY:
Oh, sure.
Yeah, we'll do a ghost adventure.

MIKE:
Oh, is this to...

MACAULAY:
Yeah, it turns up the volume.
Apparently, it's supposed to.

MIKE:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
I gotta turn it up.
I gotta start, gotta turn it on.

MIKE:
Yes.
Okay.

MACAULAY:
And you can adjust the speed.

JAY:
Ah!

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MACAULAY:
And you can do AM, you can do AM or FM, too.
So, you wanna, you wanna ask, uh, a ghost a question?

MIKE:
That's it.

JAY:
I jsut heard a ghost.
I heard one.

MIKE:
Is there...
Is there a spirit here with us at the Red Letter Media studios?

RICH:
No...

JAY:
That sounded like Mr. Plinkett.

SHAWN:	
He's saying E-R-T...

MIKE:
Oh!

SHAWN:
Tickle...

JAY:
Wouldn't it be crazy if it stopped on a station that was playing Bennie and the Jets?
That would make me a believer in ghosts if that happened.

SPIRIT BOX:
Five hospitals.

JAY:
Oh, my god.

SPIRIT BOX:
And medical centers.

MIKE:
Oh, god.
Hold on.
Oh.

RICH:
We can't stop it, folks.

JAY:
Oh, god.

MACAULAY:
It's a poltergeist.

MIKE:
Okay.
Now it's sweeping.
Oh, you can reverse sweep.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
I knew you were gonna have a ball with this thing.

MIKE:
There we go.
Tell us your name, ghost.
What is your name?

RICH:
"Herb'.
It said "Herb".

JAY:
Is it Wyatt Earp?

MIKE:
It's Wyatt Earp?

JAY:
Oh, my god.
Our studio is haunted by Wyatt Earp.

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.
Wyatt Earp.
What do we ask Wyatt Earp?

MIKE:
Wyatt Earp, how are you...
How is your ghost in Milwaukee?

RICH:
"Walked here."

MIKE:
"Walked here."

RICH:
It said "walked here".

JAY:
Oh, my god.

RICH:
The ghost of Wyatt Earp walked here.

MACAULAY:
From Tombstone, yeah.

RICH:
Wyatt.
Why did you walk here to our studio?
"Smoothies"?
Did it say "smoothies"?

SHAWN:
"Beer".
"Good beer".

JAY:
That makes sense.

MACAULAY:
That makes perfect sense, yeah.

MIKE:
This is amazing.
Thank you, Mac.

MACAULAY:
You got it.
Yeah, yeah.
I figured you'd have a ball with that thing.

MIKE:
This, we'll, we're gonna take this when we do our ghost hunt.

MACAULAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
And that's one of our, our upcoming videos.
We'll announce it now.
We have to figure out where we're gonna go.

RICH:
Sure, sure.

MACAULAY:
Now you've got all of the equipment.

MIKE:
My number one place would be the, um...
It has its own little built-in light.
Look at that.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.
It's a little switch there for on and off.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

MACAULAY:
And also this, that's, this is how you charge it.

MIKE:
Oh, okay.
Um, I would love to visit the Villisca Axe Murder House in Iowa.
It's about, it's about eight hours drive.
Eight-hour drive.

RICH:
That's fine.
It's fine.
For a very special episode?

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's one of the most haunted locations in Iowa.

MACAULAY:
So a 16-hour roundtrip for about, like, what, three hours of, uh, of, uh...

MIKE:
Well, you can, you can rent it overnight.

MACAULAY:
Oh, really?

MIKE:
Um, and, and it books up, like, a year in advance.
Uh, obviously for October.
Then after that, it's kinda easy to get there because there's no...
I don't think there's power or heat.
So, yeah.
You gotta be hardy, uh, and, uh, really into ghost-hunting to stay there overnight.
Since there's no bathrooms or heat.

MACAULAY:
Why, why is it haunted?
Like, is it...
What's the backstory?

RICH:
It's called the Axe Murder House.

JAY:
That's an unrelated name, though.

MIKE:
That's what they called the house when they built it.

MACAULAY:
So, so someone got shot, right?

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.
Well, uh...
So, there was a family there.
Uh, a mother, father...
I think they had four kids.
And then there were two unrelated kids sleeping over.
They all went to church.
They all went to the house at night.
And they had a sleepover.
And then in the middle of the night, uh, someone went around and methodically killed everyone in the house with an axe.

MACAULAY:
And they thought he was living in the attic the whole time.

MIKE:
They thought he was hiding in the attic during the day to, to come out at night.
And they never caught him.

MACAULAY:
And he stayed there for a couple of days, like, afterward even.
Like, he ate their food, and things like that.

MIKE:
I...
Oh.
Uh, yeah.
I don't...
I didn't know, hear that.
But, um...
Uh, so they thought they caught the guy, and they're like,
"Yeah, this is probably the guy."
You know, it was 1912, I believe?
Um, and he's like,
"I didn't do it."
It was, like, this drifter guy.
And they really didn't know who did it.
Um, but there's a lot of, a lot of haunted stuff that goes on there.

MACAULAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Um, the Ghost Adventures went there, and, uh...

MACAULAY:
Is that, is that the Bilbo Baggins one?

MIKE:
Uh, what?

MACAULAY:
The host.
Bilbo Baggins.

MIKE:
Oh.
Zak Bagans.

MACAULAY:
Oh, okay.

MIKE:
Yes, related to Bilbo.

JAY:
Is that the episode where he has the axe hanging above, above him?

MIKE:
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!

JAY:
And he's like,
"Come at me, bro!"

MIKE:
He lays down, and he has an axe precariously placed above his head.
And he's like, he's like, he's like,
"Push that axe on my face, bro!"

JAY:
"I dare you, ghost!"

MIKE:
Um, but they have, they have a really good, like, lockdown camera in the, the baby's room upstairs where the, the door just kind of slams closed, violently.
Whether it was faked or not, I don't know.
Um, and then I watched a different ghost...

JAY:
I wonder if the mic picked up our eyes rolling.

MACAULAY:
Rich's reaction.

JAY:
You could hear that sound.

MIKE:
You know, it's that Simpson squish sound effect.
Your eyes rolling up.
Uh, a different ghost-hunting show set up, like, uh, uh...
What is it, like, um...
Electromagnetic EMP field recorders, right?

RICH:
Uh-huh.

MIKE:
All over the house.
And then at the same time of night when the axe murderer, middle of the night, they got a spike of electromagnetic energy in the attic.
And then...

MACAULAY:
There's no electricity in the house.

MIKE:
Right.
Exactly.
Uh, and then a spike in the baby's room...

MACAULAY:
I'm following.

MIKE:
Is the same...
It followed the same path that the killer took.
All these spikes in electromagnetic...

MACAULAY:
Well, they don't know what path, really.

MIKE:
Well, they, uh, I think they did.

RICH:
Obviously it was the path the killer took.
It's the only thing that makes sense.

MIKE:
They, they, they, they...
He started in the baby's room.
And I think he killed the, uh, I think he killed parents first, obviously.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Um...

MACAULAY:
And didn't he get somebody in the barn, or something like that?
Except this one?

MIKE:
I don't know about the barn.
I think that might be something else.

MACAULAY:
All right.

MIKE:
But that's a cool location.
There's lots of cool locations.
Um...

MACAULAY:
So, but that's top in your list?

MIKE:
I, I think so.
That's the place that's the spookiest for me.

JAY:
Well, and it's realistic to get there.

MIKE:
It's realistic to get there.
There's, there's places here in Milwaukee, but they all suck.

JAY:
Some of them are bullshit.

MIKE:
Ghost Adventures didn't even come here for their serial killer episode.

JAY:
They didn't?

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Oh.

RICH:
What about Bachelor's Grove Cemetary?

MIKE:
Bachelor's Grove Cemetary, yeah.
That's, uh, that's, uh, in, uh, down in Illinois.

RICH:
That was where, near where we came from.

JAY:
Oh, okay.

MACAULAY:
Where you, where you came out of the primordial ooze?

RICH:
Yes, yes.

MIKE:
Yes.
That, that...
Ghost Adventures went to Bachelor's Grove Cemetary.

RICH:
They did?
Huh.

MIKE:
And they caught the, the mysterious floating light in the, in the woods.
The whole area was surrounded by cops.
And nobody could get in there.
And then they found the gold, the floating lantern.
They couldn't explain.
Bachelor's Grove Cemetary has a lime pit.

MACAULAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
And it's this, this murky water that goes down very deep.
And it's rumored that the mob would dump bodies there.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Because Al Capone used to hang out there.

MACAULAY:
Because lime will help dissolve the bodies.

MIKE:
Uh, there's, there's supposedly a car at the bottom.
No one's gone down there.
So, that, that's, uh, adds to the haunting.
There'a restaurant called Jack Gibbons Gardens from the 30's around the corner.
Al Capone used to hang out there.
There's a lot of mob activity in Chicago-land area.
I could talk about this for a while, too.

MACAULAY:
Oh, yeah.

RICH:
I was involved.
Didn't you do, like, a cheesy video project on Bachelor's Grove?

MIKE:
I did.
I did.
Yeah.
Yes.
I, I won an award for it, actually.
I'm not kidding.
I did.

JAY:
One of those prestigious high school class awards?

MIKE:
I, I was, uh, uh, a film and video maker award.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
I did a little video piece about Bachelor's Grove and why it was haunted.
And I had a special effect in it.
I, I keyed in a, a float...
Because people say they see a house.

RICH:
Wait.
Did you fake ghost evidence?

JAY:
Oh, my god.

MACAULAY:
Never.

MIKE:
I clearly wrote "recreation" on the bottom.
Because I...
I filmed, like, a little house and I chroma-keyed it in and, like, made it half-opacity.
And it was like,
"Whoo-o-o!"

JAY:
Oh, okay.

MIKE:
Because people say they see a spooky house floating above the lake.
There's a lot of stories from there, too.

MACAULAY:
I just love your love of ghosts.
Or, ghost-hunters, rather.

MIKE:
I do enjoy it.
I do enjoy it.
I'm fascinated by it.

MACAULAY:
I can tell.

MIKE:
I just, I, you know, it's, you know, wanna have some kind of ghost experience some day.
And it's never happened.
And I think there's, there's, there's probably a reason.

MACAULAY:
"I just want it so bad!"

JAY:
For your sake, I hope it does happen.

MIKE:
Thank you, Jay.
Thank you.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.
I'm pulling for you.

MIKE:
Now, Rich.
You believe in flat Earth.

RICH:
Oh, of course.

MIKE:
Let's, uh, let's talk about that.

MACAULAY:
Let's talk about that, yeah.

SHAWN:
Hello, and welcome to Meditation Minute.
I am your guide, Louis Prada.
Think of me as your personal chef who ensures that you nightly sup upon the succulent flesh of serenity.
Some of my most attentive -- some say obnoxious -- listeners took to social media last week to let me know that my previous episode was not quite up to my normal editorial standards.
Turns out, in my haste to get the episode recorded and published, I made a few mistakes.
I feel like I've broken your trust, so I want to begin the healing process my issuing some corrections and retractions.
At around the 30-second mark of the episode, I misspoke when I said that a global cabal of the super-rich are planning to flee the devestating effects of climate change by seeking refuge on a moon colony.
What I meant to say was...breathe in.
I have never been a world champion at anything, let alone meditation.
As far as I know, no such designation even exists.
And, if it did, I would be staunchly against it.
Self-care is not a competition.
But just know that if it was, I would be the champion of it.
I would like to clarify that while the mind's eye is definitely a real concept, a mind's pink eye is not.
But it's probably a good idea to keep fecal particles away from it all the same.
To the listeners I offended when I called them out by name and said offensive things about them, I am sorry...for not including your home addresses and social security numbers, you fucking assholes.
You know who you are.
Because I called you out.
By name.
At the 1-minute and 18-second mark, I claimed that without enough meditation, you'll be able to levitate objects with your mind.
What I meant to say, is that you could pick them up with your hands and look at them and then put them back down.
It's not so much psychokinesis as it is just basic human dexterity.
Finally, I didn't meant to imply that meditation was a scam.
It's a definitive fact.
I hope that cleared the air so we can now move to find the serenity you seek.
My name is Louis Prada, and this has been Meditation Minute.
Namaste.

RICH:
No, I don't.

MACAULAY:
I know.
I'm actually fascinated with the flat-Earth, like, people.
Like, I, I, I'm constantly...
Like, almost, I'd say about three times a week, I, I, I type into YouTube...

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, "flat-Earth" something.

RICH:
I went through a phase where I was fascinated by them.
I think I'm over it now.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
I'm, I'm over flat-Earthers.

JAY:
Well, they probably only have a limited amount talking points, right?

MACAULAY:
Arguments to be made, yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
I would think.

RICH:
The weird thing is, I, the, the conspiracy.
Like, there's no motivation for there to be a conspiracy to cover the globe up.

MACAULAY:
That's...
Every single one, you try to figure, it's like,
"But why?"

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
Why?

RICH:
"They don't want you to know about the globe!"

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Why?

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
But why?
"Because science grant money!"

MACAULAY:
NASA and stuff.

RICH:
They can also, they can also make grant money studying a flat Earth.
So, I mean...

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Like, to what end?
Well, also, every, like, airline pilot in the world would have to be in on it.

RICH:
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

MACAULAY:
Because otherwise it wouldn't make any...
And, look, my, my stepfather is a pilot.
And, uh, he can't keep his mouth shut.
And, he's, uh, he, he likes to drink hard, and all that kind of stuff.
And it's, like, there's no fucking way that, like, he could keep a secret like that.

JAY:
Some Christmas, he's gonna have a little too much and expose the truth.

MACAULAY:
That's what I'm saying.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
So, you know...
Like, I'm pretty sure, you know, Mark can't, can't keep that secret.
So, um, uh, uh...
Mike and Rich actually kind of came up with an idea for a movie...

MIKE:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
Yesterday.

MIKE:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
The Uncanny Valley.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
Well, well, in the news lately...
We should set this up.
There's, uh, uh, a new World War II movie...

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Starring James fucking Dean.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Well, it's not, it's not out yet.

RICH:
No.

MIKE:
It's in, it's in, it was announced.

MACAULAY:
It was just announced, yeah.

JAY:
They got...
They had to get attention for their sleazy project, so they announced it.
Yeah.
"We looked at hundreds of actors."
"The only one we could find for the part was James Dean."
"Who's not the right actor for any part because he's fucking dead."

MACAULAY:
He's dead-dead.

MIKE:
Yes.
Who's making this film?

JAY:
I, I had never even heard of the filmmaker.

MACAULAY:
Sam...

JAY:
I think that's why they did this...

MIKE:
A gimmick?

JAY:
Just to get attention for their, their dumb movie.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, and I doubt they're gonna follow through with it.
Like, how much backlash...

JAY:
It's gotten a lot of back...
Well, and it's so sleazy.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
If they were at least honest about it, where they're just like,
"Yeah, we're doing a gimmick."
Like, I would at least respect that a little bit...

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
Even though it's still weird.
But the fact that they're trying to say,
"He's the best actor for the role!"
He's not an actor.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
He's a computer...
You're making an animated character, basically.

MACAULAY:
He only did three movies, anyway.
Small sample size.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But an actor makes choices.
And a CG creation can't make choices.
So he's not an actor.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.
Tou-, touche.

JAY:
Or, or they cast somebody, and that person acts out the role, and they put James Dean's face on him.
In which case, that's not James Dean acting.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
We were saying that they'd probably have to list, like, three credits for James Dean's character.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
It would be James Dean.
It would be the body actor.
And then the voice actor.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Yeah.
And then the CGI artist.

MACAULAY:
Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
The wall of CGI artists.

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
The 500 people that are bringing James Dean to life that will never get credit for it.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.
So, uh, The Uncanny Valley.
Uh, do you guys, do you guys...
Pitch it.
Pitch it.

RICH:
We heard about this, and, uh, we had an idea that, let's just make a movie starring nothing but dead actors.

MIKE:
Yes.

RICH:
And, and...

JAY:
Dead celebrities.

RICH:
Dead celebrities.

JAY:
In general, yeah.

RICH:
And we'll, we'll call it The Uncanny Valley.

MIKE:
Yes.
And The Uncanny Valley is a, a futuristic theme park that you go to.
And I guess there's holo-projectors like Star Trek, right?

RICH:
Uh-huh.

MIKE:
Um, and they project holograms of your favorite dead celebrities for you to hang out with, you know?
Go swimming in the pool...

MACAULAY:
Marilyn Monroe.

MIKE:
With Marilyn Monroe.

MACAULAY:
Elvis Presley.

MIKE:
Yes.
Go see a concert by the, the Rat Pack...whatever.
I don't know.
Um, and, uh, and they can look...
The CGI doesn't have to be perfect, right?
Because...

MACAULAY:
It's the uncanny valley.

MIKE:
It makes sense in context of the movie.
It could be really good.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But, you know, I...
That's why I don't think they can pull off the James Dean thing 100%.

RICH:
Oh, of course not.

MIKE:
I mean, five seconds...

RICH:
Well, they'll get, they'll get...
Even if they can't now, they'll get there.

MIKE:
Well, yeah.
I know.
Yeah, maybe.

RICH:
We'll get a, we'll get across the uncanny valley, and then...

MIKE:
And then...

MACAULAY:
You know, they were kind of close with Peter Cushing.
But then, uh, but then Carrie Fisher was, was...

MIKE:
Ooh.

JAY:
Well, then Peter Cushing talked.

MIKE:
Peter Cushing...
Yes.

JAY:
They look great when they're just still.
When it's just their face.
But when they start talking, that's where you really notice...

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Like, something's off about the mouth, and...

RICH:
I don't even think Peter Cushing in, in Rogue One was that great.
It was really off-putting to me.

MI.KE:
No.
Yeah.
It was...

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Me, too.
I don't...
It was a little, little too uncanny valley.
Like, it really was.

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, a little close, but not enough that it became this irking, you know, for some.

MIKE:
It looked like a cartoon.
Yeah, and that was, like, I don't know, probably 30 seconds of footage of him after all is said and done, you know?
MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
The Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong...
That looked really good in the new Terminator movie.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
I still haven't seen that yet.

MIKE:
And that was, that's...
It's less, like, a full CG...
I guess, uh, uh...

RICH:
Like, Edward Furlong.
That can't just be de-aging.

JAY:
Oh, no.
That's...
I'm sure they went all...

MIKE:
Oh.
No, no, no.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
They got, they...
And same with Linda Hamilton.
They got two body types that very closesly matched the body types of the actors from '92, '93, whatever.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
'91.
Um, and then I think they basically deep-faked some kind of CGI face.
But it looks really good.

JAY:
It looks good.
But you don't really see him talk much.

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Like, Linda Hamilton's just sitting there.

MIKE:
There's no talking.
That...
The mouth is the worst part.

JAY:
You hear Edward Furlong, but he's, like, really far away from the camera when he's talking.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's kind of, like, off-camera.
He's like,
"Hey, mom!"

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"I'm getting some drinks!"

JAY:
They were smart.
They knew how to do it.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Don't show their mouth, because fake CGI mouths always look...

JAY:
Yeah.
They always look weird.

MIKE:
There's something wrong with them.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And you're like,
"What's wrong with the mouth?"
Um...
But anyway.
Uncanny Valley.

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yes.
Keep pitching.

MIKE:
Um, so.
Imagine many scenarios where you could hang out with celebrities who have long since passed at this resort.
And then a storm comes in.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Of course.
Um, and then you have the big computer server tower that, that controls everything.
And lightning strikes it.

RICH:
The cheapskate company.
They, they cheaped out when it came to lightning rods.

MIKE:
Lightning...

MACAULAY:
There's gotta be...
There's gotta be, like, some...

RICH:
You gotta have the heroic safety inspector.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
"This park doesn't have enough lightning rods!"

MACAULAY:
Exactly.
The, the tech that they didn't listen to.
Like, I mean, yeah.

MIKE:
"It's fine."
"We don't get thunderstorms in California."
"Southern California."
Um, and so that fries the computer system that's controlling, uh, the celebrities, and they all turn into psychopaths.

MACAULAY:
So turn it into Jurassic Park.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Jurassic Park.

JAY:
The first...
It kind of starts out like Westworld.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
I haven't watched the HBO show, but the original movie Westworld.

MIKE:
Oh, sure.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
I guess it's similar to that.

JAY:
You, you can go to the little, like, western town, and there's different areas.
Something like that.

MIKE:
Itchy & Scratchy Land.

JAY:
Itchy & Scratchy Land.

MACAULAY:
Yes.
Yeah.
Yep.

MIKE:
And, and go there, um...

JAY:
And then it turns into Jurassic Park.

RICH:
It's a very unoriginal idea.

MACAULAY:
No.
I think it's fantastic.

JAY:
It's an original twist on an old classic.

MIKE:
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
So, um...

RICH:
That's how to spin it!

MIKE:
Yeah.
What were some of the scenarios we came up with?

RICH:
Well, I know the celebrities were going to start, like, killing people related to how they died.

MIKE:
Our, our first one was that they, they tried to leave the park, um, and they, you know, they steal a car.
But then they realize they're being followed by James Dean who's trying to run them off the road.

RICH:
James Dean is terrorizing people in the parking lot in a car.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
He's trying to run people over.
Cause car accidents.

MIKE:
But then they...

RICH:
It's, it's the very same car.
The park bought it for authenticity.

MIKE:
Yeah.
But he, he ends up crashing his car into a light, light post.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Like, don't use the toilet, because that's where Elvis is gonna get you.

MIKE:
Yes, yes.

JAY:
He's like a ghoulie.
He's gonna pop out.

RICH:
He just drowns people in the toilet.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
He starts feeding you, like, fried peanut butter sandwiches.
"I eat about 10,000 of these."
Um, so they, do they kill you the way they died?
Is it like...

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Remember, I said Kurt Cobain has a shotgun, and he's, like, shooting at you.
Um...

JAY:
He's chasing everybody around.

MACAULAY:
JFK's a sniper.

MIKE:
Right.

RICH:
He was gonna be the villain, wasn't he?

MIKE:
Who?

JAY:
JFK?

RICH:
JFK...

MIKE:
Oh, no.
Marilyn Monroe gets killed, and it turns it's JFK.

MACAULAY:
No.
She just tries to keep on shoving pills down people's throats.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.
No, we were doing a twist where he was secretly assassinated her.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Because that's the conspiracy.
Because she knew too much.

MACAULAY:
Yep.

MIKE:
She knew about JFK's sex rows.

MACAULAY:
We should ask her ghost.

MIKE:
Oh.
Let's turn on the spirit box.
Marilyn, are you here in Milwaukee?

JAY:
Our studio is haunted by Wyatt Earp and Marilyn Monroe.

RICH:
Marilyn Monroe, would you give us the rights to use your likeness?

MIKE:
Yes!

RICH:
Turn it up!
Turn it up!
Let's ask...
Let's start asking celebrities for their likeness for their rights right now.

MIKE:
That's, that's how we'll prove it in court later after the movie is made.

JAY:
There you go.

MIKE:
"Yes."
"Tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch!"

MACAULAY:
"We asked!"

MIKE:
Yeah, that...

RICH:
Marilyn Monroe clearly consented to have her likeness used in our movie.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
We asked, we asked the spirit box.

JAY:
Marilyn Monroe's ghost...

MIKE:
We'll get a judge that's sympathetic to paranormal activities.
"The Honorable Zak Bagans presiding."
"Judge for a day, bro!"
Sorry.
Sorry about that.

MACAULAY:
Marilyn Monroe, if you're really here, just hit that gavel for me, would ya?

MIKE:
Big floats with strings on it.
Uh, yeah.

JAY:
So who's, who's the equivalent of the T-Rex in this world?

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
Who's, like, the big baddie?

MIKE:
Marlon Brando?

JAY:
He just tries to feed you to death.

RICH:
I was gonna say Orson Welles.
But, yeah.

MIKE:
"I swallowed a baby."

MACAULAY:
"I swallowed a baby."

MIKE:
He just, he's just, he gets even fatter in the afterlife.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
He's just smashing through doors.

JAY:
He's, like, uh, what is that...

MIKE:
Juggernaut.

JAY:
Uh...

RICH:
No.
There's, there's an extra problem with the projector.
He just keeps getting bigger.
Part of the malfunction.

MIKE:
Yes.
There you go.
Yeah.

JAY:
So, not like physically fatter?
Just larger.

MIKE:
It's distorting him.

RICH:
The original...
The original recreation, actually, of Marlon Brando was young Marlon Brando.

MIKE:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
Oh.
And then he evolves...

RICH:
But after the malfunction, he just keeps getting fatter and fatter and larger.

MACAULAY:
And fatter and older.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
He turns into...
What is that?
Is that an X-Men character, the Blob?

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
He starts looking like that, and just, like, rolling around the park.
Trying to choke everybody with sandwiches and fried chicken.
Shove it down their throats.

MIKE:
"Oh, god."
This is, this is a movie Martin Scorcese would call "cinema".
"We're gonna ruin everything you love, Marty."
"Everything."

JAY:
We're taking down the legacy of every dead celebrity with us.

MACAULAY:
I'm sure their families will be totally fine with it.
Yeah.

JAY:
You just give 'em a check.

RICH:
I was just gonna say the same thing.

JAY:
James Dean's estate, they're like,
"Yeah, fine."
"Put, put James Dean in your movie."
"You're gonna give us a check?"

MIKE:
"He's gonna be a psychopath."
"Trying to kill everyone."

MACAULAY:
It's fine, as long as we get a check.

MIKE:
Would, would, like, the, the, The Matrix, when it gets scrambled, would, would, would dead, I guess dead bad celebrities be good then?

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
Like, famous serial killers.
Things like that.

RICH:
Ehh...

MIKE:
I guess you...

MACAULAY:
Well, if you start recruiting, like, Ted Bundy?

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
That'd be a twist if, like, Ed Gein turned out to be helpful to whatever, whoever the protagonists of the movie are.

MIKE:
But I guess there wouldn't be a program for them, anyways.
Because who would want to go to a resort and hang out with Ed Gein?

JAY:
Sickos.

MACAULAY:
Actually, there, there...
I think there's a, there's a, there's a subculture for that, for sure.

MIKE:
There's a market.
Okay.

RICH:
"Quick!"
"Quick, Jeffrey Dahmer!"
"You have to eat Marlon Brando!"

JAY:
It's like the conclusion of Jurassic World, where the two dinosaurs have to fight.

MIKE:
Mike.

JAY:
We got Marlon Brando versus Jeffrey Dahmer.

MIKE:
A big...
Just give them a big steak knife and a fork.

JAY:
We don't even need human protagonists in this movie.
It can just all be the holograms.

MIKE:
You see a family.
Just a little family running around.

JAY:
They disappear halfway through the movie.
Who cares?

MIKE:
You need a heart, Jay.
You need the heart of the story.

JAY:
And then you can abandon it halfway through like those kids in Jurassic World.

MIKE:
You need a mother...

JAY:
"Our parents are going through a divorce!"
"Oh, and then we're just never gonna mention that again."

MIKE:
The father works in Washington.
And he's flying to get to, the Uncanney Valley.

RICH:
Oh.
You could have a love triangle.
You could have the wife of a dead celebrity visiting the park with her new husband.

MIKE:
Oh!
There you go.

MACAULAY:
Oh...
I like it.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
But you also have to use someone who's recently dead, though.

RICH:
Or make somebody up.
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
But there needs to be a thing, too, where there, they have to escape the park.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, uh, Truman Show kind of situation.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Oh.
Yeah.

MIKE:
You have to...

MACAULAY:
Or you have to shut down the mainframe somehow.

MIKE:
Right.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
But the...
Because...
But the, it's, your, and, your exits are all blocked.
That's how the James Dean car crash happens in the beginning.
Trying, trying to get to the...
Like, uh, Cabin in the Woods, right?

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
With the holgoraphic tunnel and all that.

MACAULAY:
Well, I, I, I pitched also yesterday, I would show up.

MIKE:
Oh, right.

MACAULAY:
And then I'm going,
"I'm not dead, guys."
"Just, for real."
"That's messed up, guys."
"Don't kill me."

MIKE:
I just came to this park, and now I'm trapped.

MACAULAY:
I'm just like you!

MIKE:
The party in the hotel room.
And the door opens.
And, uh, John...

RICH:
Do you die at some point during the film when the matrix in the park automatically recreates you as a hologram?

MIKE:
Oh...

MACAULAY:
Like an impostor Mac?

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.

MACAULAY:
Or, or, I'm, I'm there, but there's, like, there's a younger me that's dead.

RICH:
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.

MIKE:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
The younger you.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
That's, like, uh...

MACAULAY:
That's how they recreate me.

JAY:
Gemini Man, right?
Isn't that that Will Smith movie?

MACAULAY:
Oh.
Uh, uh, Gemini Man?

JAY:
Where it's him having to fight the younger version of himself.

MIKE:
Yeah.
You have to fight Kevin McCallister.

JAY:
You have to beat up an 11-year old.
That'd be great.

JAY:
What would you do if they wanted to have, like, a CG version of you in, like, Home Alone 6?
Whatever they're up to now.

MACAULAY:
Only if Rian Johnson was directing it.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
How many zeroes are on the check?

MACAULAY:
Exactly.

MIKE:
That's, that's the appropriate answer.

JAY:
All of them.

MIKE:
There's so many things you can do with this amazing concept.

JAY:
This amzing technology to bring back dead celebrities.

MIKE:
Right.

JAY:
That's what they were...
That was the most disgusting thing about that article about the James Dean thing, is when they're like,
"This opens up so many opportunities for our, our, uh, celebrities that aren't with us anymore!"

MIKE:
Yes, yes.

JAY:
Like, you fucking scumbags.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
We need more Burt Reynolds.
That's what we need.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, yeah, yeah.

JAY:
Let's not get any new actors.
Let's just recreate old ones.
That's a creepy precedence, too.
And that's...
The James Dean thing is, like, the worst example of it.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
But I think we talked about that when we talked about the new Terminator movie, where it's like,
"Yeah, we don't have any new ideas."
"We'll just recreate the stuff from 30 years ago."

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
All they gotta do, is they make a new Star Wars film with a young Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher.
And everyone will love the idea.

JAY:
They'll do it.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Don't tempt them.

JAY:
Give it five more years, and they'll do it.

MIKE:
Like some kind of adventure that took...

RICH:
Yeah.
After Return of the Jedi.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Or, yeah, in between I and IV and V.
So, a little bit of gap there, right?

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
They have to get to Hoth...

MACAULAY:
Like, a year goes by there, yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Sold.
Greenlit.

MIKE:
Episode 4.5, right?

RICH:
I'm shocked, I'm actually shocked they haven't tried that yet.
I actually am.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
I think, I think the key word is "yet".

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, for real.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
Well, they tried to...
They wanted to do their new trilogy.
And now that that's fizzling out, that's when they start digging up stuff like that.
Those ideas.

MIKE:
That'll be, that'll be the future.
We'll say,
"Remember when they used to use real people in movies?"
It's possible.
It's possible.

MACAULAY:
We're getting there.

MIKE:
We're getting there.

MACAULAY:
They're gonna use real people.
They're just gonna put other celebrity's face on them.
Like, that's gonna happen.

MIKE:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
So, are you guys excited about Episode XI?

RICH:
To be fair, I haven't been excited since the prequel era.

MACAULAY:
Oh, yeah?

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, even the, the, the JJ Abrams...

RICH:
It was like...
I, I, I, like, I agree to the new ones with mild curiosity.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
You know.
That was interesting.
What are they gonna do?
Oh, okay.

MACAULAY:
So you don't, so you don't go opening weekend or anything like that?

RICH:
I, I went for work.

MACAULAY:
Oh, okay.
Gotcha.

RICH:
I, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be honest.
I probably wouldn't have otherwise.

MACAULAY:
Really?

RICH:
I, I would've gotten around to it.
Like, it would have been like,
"Eventually I'll see it."

MACAULAY:
Gotcha.
Like a digital download or ebay or something.

JAY:
You, you wouldn't have even seen, uh, Revenge of the Sith if you weren't physically forced to go.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
That was, that was different entirely because I actively...
Like, I still say to this day that Attack of the Clones, relative to its budget, is the worst film ever made.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Like, like, like...
Yeah, some of the crap we watch on Best of the Worst is worse.

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah.

RICH:
But they didn't spend...

JAY:
But it costs pennies to make.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, it cost a dime.

RICH:
Yeah, it cost pennies to make.
They did not spend $200 million making things.

JAY:
Right.

MACAULAY:
But what about that factory scene, though?
That was so complicated.

JAY:
It was pretty whacky.

MACAULAY:
It really was.

JAY:
That's, that's...
When I think of Star Wars, that's what I think of, is whacky.

MACAULAY:
That's so whacky.

JAY:
Whacky conveyor belt, Looney Tunes nonsense.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
How could you not love that, dude?
What's wrong with you?

JAY:
R2-D2 flying.

RICH:
I'm just, I'm just scowling.
That's, that's what I'm doing right now.
I'm scowling.

MIKE:
A permanent scowl.

MACAULAY:
How about, how about, how about you guys?
You excited about XI?
You have anticipation?
Like, JJ Abrams is back..

MIKE:
I think each film is just curiosity, rather than excitement.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MACAULAY:
And, like, I'm kind of, like, I'm not really excited about it.

MIKE:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
But I'm a completionist.
So, going, I have to see it.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Well, sure.
Yeah, that's the thing, too.
It's almost like, you feel like a hypocrite or something.
I gotta see it just to complete it, but...
The first one I was excited about, you know?
Uh...

JAY:
Well, that's the interesting thing, is to see how, like, perceptions have shifted just in the matter of, like, three, four years now?

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
We were all, like...
Yeah, Force Awakens is like,
"Oh, okay."
"This is a good start to a new, a new thing."
"It feels like Star Wars."

MIKE:
Just now, do something different.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then they did something too different.

MACAULAY:
But it all...
It wasn't too different.
It just wasn't good.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
That's the thing.

MIKE:
There was a lot of problems with that.

MACAULAY:
Is that I, like, you know, like, you see, like...
Marvel movies, they do a rich variety of, you know, like,
"Here's a spy thriller."
"Or here's a..."

JAY:
Oh, sure.

MACAULAY:
Like, all kind of, like, weird origin stories.
And all that kind of stuff.
Like, yeah.
And, like, yeah.
There's, like, 20-something movies in that.
But it's still, like, I'd say there's only a little bit of Marvel fatigue starting to set in.
Whereas, like, Star Wars, like, they got, like, four into it and everyone's like,
"No, we're done."

JAY:
Yeah.


MACAULAY:
"We're done."

JAY:
Well, that's what's interesting when you hear people say like,
"Oh, they were just releasing too many Star Wars movies too quick."
And then, yeah.
You look at Marvel, and they've had no problem releasing, like, three movies a year.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Exactly.
So, no.
It, I think it has more of a question of quality, really, than anything else.

MIKE:
Well, and...

RICH:
It's amazing what can happen when somebody competent behind the scenes has a plan.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
I think that's the biggest thing is, has a plan.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
Because that was the most shocking thing before, uh, Last Jedi came out, when...
I, I don't know if it was Rian Johnson or JJ Abrams, but one of them mentioned like,
"Yeah, we don't know what we're gonna do with the next movie."

RICH:
I was, I was, I was worried before Force Awakens came out, when JJ Abrams, like, wasn't doing the next one.
I'm like,
"Wait a minute."

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
"Why not?"
"Why isn't there a consistent vision here?"
"What's going on?"

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Why isn't there a cap-, someone captaining the ship?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Mm.

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Other than Kathleen Kennedy.

JAY:
Yeah.
Well, I've seen some people say like,
"Well, the original trilogy wasn't planned out."
It's like,
"Well, yeah."
"But that also wasn't..."
"It's not what Star Wars is now."

RICH:
Empire was a fluke.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
And Return of the Jedi was okay at best.

JAY:
Right.
Like, yeah.
That wasn't...
I know George Lucas has said,
"Oh, yeah."
"I had all the stories planned out."
Which is bullshit.

MIKE:
It's a lie.

JAY:
But that's, that's forgiveable because it's, like, they made Star Wars.
"Oh, it's a big hit!"
"Let's make more."
But, yeah.
Now, like, you have to plan this stuff out.

MACAULAY:
I, I just think he overwrote the first script.
And so he had material left over.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
It wasn't, like, yeah.
I don't think he had a nine episode sweeping saga.

JAY:
Right.

MACAULAY:
Like, you know.
Yeah.

MIKE:
His first, his script for Star Wars was all three movies.
It was, like, 700 pages long.
"Ehh, we can't do that."

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Break it up.

MACAULAY:
And it's like he had things, like, he had a character in the original, his name was Mace Windy.

MIKE:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
You know, so it's, like, oh, so...
No, for real.

JAY:
Is that true?

MACAULAY:
That's true.

JAY:
Oh.

MACAULAY:
And so they cut that.
He used the characters...

JAY:
Oddly enough, he had Samuel L. Jackson in mind.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Nothing, nothing to do, like, nothing to do with any, uh, you know, what that character ended up being.

JAY:
So it's just a name?

MACAULAY:
He just used the name.

JAY:
Oh, I'm sure.

MACAULAY:
And he spruced it up with a, with a "u" instead of a "y".

RICH:
Cult-, culturally, has Marvel replaced Star Wars?

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Kids don't care about Star Wars.

MACAULAY:
A whole generation.
Yeah.
A whole generation of kids.

JAY:
Yeah, the younger, younger kids do not care about Star Wars.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's true.
Mm-hmm.
Just the, the toys alone...

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Star Wars toys are just, like, no kids play with those.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MACAULAY:
You know, it's just those collectors, pretty much.
Like, you know, the, the adult collectors.
Like, yeah.
They want a mint-in-box.
But that's pretty much it.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, you don't really...

MIKE:
No.

MACAULAY:
There's not a lot of kids that...

MIKE:
They're always on clearance.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
All the Star Wars toys.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Kids have something they like, I'm fine.
It's all good.

MIKE:
Because it's so, like, beige and blah.
Like, all those characters.
You know what I mean?

MACAULAY:
They literally wear beige or black.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, that's it.
Like, and, yeah.

RICH:
And, like, Star Wars is this vast world.
Infinite possibilities.

MACAULAY:
All kinds, all kinds of universes.

MIKE:
Kids, kids like...

RICH:
I'm gonna get...
I'm gonna wind up getting in a fucking rant about this shit.

JAY:
It's exhausting, isn't it?

RICH:
Yeah, it is.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Frustrating.

MIKE:
Uh, yeah.
Culturally, Marvel has replaced Star Wars.

JAY:
Oh, sure.

MIKE:
I, I agree with that.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And it's, like, it's on, it's on its deathbed.
That's...
We'll see what happens with Episode XI.
But, uh...

MACAULAY:
I'm, I'm holding my breath, but I'm not going opening weekend.

MIKE:
No.
I mean, we will.

MACAULAY:
You guys have to.

JAY:
But we're not...
And this is important to mention.
We're not going into it wanting to hate it.

MACAULAY:
No, of course not.

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Like, I'm curious to see what they do.
I hope they pull something off.

MACAULAY:
There's a, like, yeah.
There's a reason why you're so critical of it a lot of times.
Because you love it so much.

JAY:
It's...
Well, it started as something special.
And we've talked about that.
Like, the original three movies...

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
The reason they're so well-liked is because they were just good movies.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
And now it's, like, you're either pre-conditioned to hate it because you don't like what Disney's done with it, or you go into just loving it because it's Star Wars.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
And there's, like, no in-between where you can be critical of it at all.
Where you're like,
"Some of it was good."
"Some of it was bad."

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
There were some people that were mad at us because we didn't hate The Last Jedi more.
Which is just so bizarre, like...

MACAULAY:
I fucking hated it so bad.
So hard.

JAY:
I appreciated that it was trying to...
Everybody knows "subverting expectations" is, like, a meme now.

MACAULAY:
Oh, that's a participation badge, though, you know?

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
"Oh, you tried."

JAY:
You know, you gotta do something different.
And he kind of tried, but he didn't...

RICH:
It didn't work.

JAY:
Replace it.
Yeah, it didn't work.
He didn't replace it with something new and interesting.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
It was just,
"All those things that we set up in the last movie..."

MACAULAY:
"Just kidding!"

JAY:
"Nope!"

MACAULAY:
Mm-hm.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
It's like,
"Okay, but what are you doing new?"

MIKE:
You could get away with that with a couple of plot threads.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But...

JAY:
But it was the whole movie.

MIKE:
Just ended so badly.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's really the ending.
Like, everyone complains about the low-speed chase.
You know, with the ships?
I actually liked that.

RICH:
That didn't bother me at all.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Running out of fuel.
Whatever.
It was neat.
But then everybody's, like, coming and going, you know?
And there's, like, logic gaps...

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Where it's like,
"Why don't, why don't the escape pods have, have, uh warp speed?"
Light speed.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
X-Wings have light speed.

MACAULAY:
Hyperspace.

MIKE:
Hyperspace.

MACAULAY:
Hyperspeed.
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Like, you think an escape craft would have hyperspeed.
Because you're escaping something.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Seems like the most common thing you would install.
But they were going, like, five miles an hour.
And they're being picked off left and right.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
"Put escape speed..."
"Put, uh..."
Sorry.
"Escape speed."
"Put light speed on those escape crafts."
Um, so I was, like, I was, like, ehh...
Doesn't make sense.

MACAULAY:
Well, one of the things I didn't understand was why, uh, uh, Laura Dern's character, like, just wouldn't explain to, to what's-his-name...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, right.
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Why, why...

JAY:
It was purely for, like, story convenience.

MACAULAY:
For, for drama.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Like, for no reason.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MACAULAY:
Like, no wonder he's mutinying.
Because it's like,
"I don't freaking know you."
"And all of a sudden you show up."
"And now, you know, yeah."
It doesn't make any sense.

MIKE:
The moral of the story is you're supposed to blindly trust other people.

MACAULAY:
Yes, exactly.

MIKE:
Not trust...

JAY:
And that's, and that's what Star Wars, the original movies, were founded on, yeah.

RICH:
That's what a true Rebel gets.

MACAULAY:
A true Rebel listens to a purple-haired stranger.

MIKE:
Yes, Rich.
Blindly follow your leaders.

JAY:
It was also weird when you get to the end of Last Jedi, and, like, Poe Dameron introduces himself to Rey, and you're like,
"Oh, yeah."
"We're at the end of the second movie..."

MACAULAY:
And they haven't even met.

JAY:
"And they no idea who the other one is."

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
These are our characters.

MIKE:
Rey's too busy running with her lightsaber out.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"It's burning up that fuel cell."
"Oh, shit!"
"It's out of power!"
"Here comes Snoke!"
Ehh...
Yeah, and then, uh, yeah...
I think the big crux is, like, the heart of the story is Rey and, uh, what's that guy's name?

MACAULAY:
Oh, Kylo Ren?

JAY:
Kylo Ren.

MIKE:
Adam, Adam Levine.
Adam Corolla.
Adam...
Adam...
Adam...

RICH:
Driver.

MIKE:
Adam...
What?

RICH:
Driver, isn't it?

MIKE:
Adam Driver, yeah.
Her and Kylo Ren in their...

MACAULAY:
I thought you were going to say MacGyver.

JAY:
That's what I thought it was, too.

RICH:
Adam MacGyver.

MIKE:
Adam MacGyver?

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
It's how he built his lightsaber.

MIKE:
That scene, though, when they team up.
Even though they should have fought the guards...
See, that's another thing.
I think we went over all of this in my Plinkett review.

JAY:
I think everybody's gone over everything in The Last Jedi.

MIKE:
You fight the guards before you kill Snoke.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You fight the guards.
You kill 'em all.

JAY:
But, Mike.
That's what you would expect.

MACAULAY:
Yes, exactly.

MIKE:
Ah, yes!
He gotcha!

MACAULAY:
Subverting expectations.

MIKE:
After Snoke has died, if I were a guard, and my job was to guard a guy, and the guy was now dead, I would run.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, I'm, I'm outtie.
Like, yeah.

MIKE:
Bye!

JAY:
You wouldn't just blindly fight these two people that you don't know anything about?

RICH:
Especially when the guy you're fighting is probably gonna be the guy who would be paying your next paycheck.

MACAULAY:
Yes, exactly.

MIKE:
Ah, yes.
Yes, we all would bow to him.
"You have def-..."
Yeah.
It's, like, someone overthrows...

MACAULAY:
"You have defeated me..."
"Defeated my Lord."

MIKE:
Right.
Someone overthrows the king, and,
"I'm on your side now!"
"I'm working for you, yeah."
Or, just show, like, their head roll on the ground, and it's got, like, circuits in it.
They're robots.
I don't know.
"But who were those guys?"
"Why do they, why do they keep..."
"I'm just gonna fight to the death."
Just because.
That's, that, stuff like that, ehh...
And then, then, then they had the great team-up moment, you know?

JAY:
That's where it should have ended.
I'm sure we talked about that.

MIKE:
"I'm still mad."
"I'm gonna keep going."
That's, ugh, wh-, why?

MACAULAY:
Well, because, I mean, the whole moral of the story was, it's like, uh, or at least part of, like, the, uh, Rey's, like, story was that, like, oh, like, Luke was trying to teach her that it's not black and white.
It's not just good guys, bad guys.
There's a gray area in there.
That's kind of what he's pushing.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
There are no more Jedis.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MACAULAY:
That kind of thing.

MIKE:
Because you don't want heroes or villains in your movie about heroes and villains.
You want a gray area.

MACAULAY:
Well, it's just, like, I thought, I thought that could've been neat when it comes to, uh, uh, uh, Rylo Ken...

RICH:
If you had Allen Moore write it and went all in on the gray area...

MIKE:
Sure.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
It would be fucking amazing.

MACAULAY:
Exactly.

RICH:
But they would never do that.

MACAULAY:
See, like, like, Rey should've gone with Rylo Ken.
Like, at the end.

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Or, at least when he held out his hand...

RICH:
Well, that would've been, that would've been...

MACAULAY:
Hold out his hand, like, you, you, that's where you end the movie.

JAY:
That's when you cut to credits.

MACAULAY:
And it's, like, okay...

MIKE:
Yes.
Nice, nice cliffhanger.

RICH:
Because that would've been a legit cliffhanger, and I would actually be interested in watching Rise of Skywalker.

MACAULAY:
Yes.

JAY:
Yes.

RICH:
If they did that.

MACAULAY:
And it's also...
And, like, you, you think that she's taking Luke's lessons to heart.

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Maybe it's, like,
"Oh."
"Maybe, like, you know, I can bring..."
"There's somewhere in the middle."
"Like, you know, if him and I rule the galaxy together..."

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
It'll be a balance there.

JAY:
Mm-hmm.

MACAULAY:
But no.

JAY:
But then it just ends with, yeah, good guys, bad guys, Kylo Ren yelling.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
"Shoot 'em!"

MACAULAY:
Hol-, hologram Luke Hamill.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
No.
Uh, uh...

MACAULAY:
Force ghost.

MIKE:
Uh, Bill, Billie Mays.

JAY:
Oh, that's right.
You said he looks like Billie Mays.

MIKE:
He has, like, a full, full brown beard.
He looks totally different.
And then he has a...
Is his lightsaber green?

RICH:
His hair is cut and, and well-groomed.

MACAULAY:
No, his light...
His lightsaber is green because he, like, yeah.
He actually had a blue one.
He got his old one back.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
But in the, in the...

MACAULAY:
And then, when he was a Force ghost, it was green.
Like, yeah.

MIKE:
I think it was...

MACAULAY:
There were certain kind of tells.

MIKE:
I think it was...

RICH:
No, it was blue in the Force ghost, right?

MIKE:
I think it was...

MACAULAY:
Was it blue?

MIKE:
That was the weird part.
Because he has his, he had his Jedi saber, the green one when he tried to kill Kylo Ren.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And then, um, obviously Rey has the original, you know, the Darth Vader lightsaber.
And so in the, in the hologram version, it was blue.
And so I was like,
"Why is it blue?"
"It should've been green."

MACAULAY:
Oh, because she tried to hand back his old lightsaber.

RICH:
That was another, that was another hint, though, that it was a hologram.

MIKE:
That was another hint.

RICH:
The holo...

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
The Force-projection Luke was using the Anakin lightsaber.

MIKE:
Yes.
Yeah, exactly.
So it was really obvious that something was fishy going on there.
Kylo Ren didn't put it together.

RICH:
Because Kylo, Kylo Ren, our major villain, is a complete dumbass.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
That, that, the end of that movie did not do that character any favors.

MACAULAY:
No.

JAY:
Which sucks, because he's been the most interesting character in these features.

MACAULAY:
And now he's, like, the big bad, too.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
He's your main antagonist, you know, from now on especially.

JAY:
But now he's not very threatening.

RICH:
Well, no, no.
The main antagonist is the Emperor, because they're at least smart enough to realize they fucked up Kylo Ren.
So we're just going back to the Emperor.
And, you know what?
It's gonna be fun.
I don't even, I don't even care.

JAY:
That's the one thing I'm looking forward to.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
I don't even care.

JAY:
Even if, yeah.
I don't care how it's explained.

MACAULAY:
I bet you, I bet you we get less than five minutes worth of that.

JAY:
Maybe.

MACAULAY:
I think that's just a big tease for all of us.

JAY:
Could be.

MACAULAY:
To, you know, whet our beaks.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, get us all excited.

JAY:
Well, that's, like, yeah.
Was it the first teaser trailer that ended with, uh, like, dark Rey?
They called it where, like, she was evil, and you're like,
"That's gonna be five seconds in the movie, and it's gonna be a..."

MACAULAY:
It's gonna be a dream.

JAY:
"A dream."
She's not gonna turn evil, because if she was, they wouldn't put that in the trailer.

RICH:
Unless they do time travel, and an older Rey is the antagonist.

RICH:
Could be.

MACAULAY:
Oh, god.
Please don't ruin this, like, universe even more by adding time travel nonsense.

RICH:
Oh, universe has been ruined for 20 years.

MACAULAY:
I know

RICH:
Who cares at this point?

JAY:
I root fo rnonsense.

MACAULAY:
It becomes convoluted, yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.
You could roll back the time travel prediction a little.
I think, I think we're going with alternate dimensions.

JAY:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
Oh, my gosh.

MIKE:
Because we got, they got all those Star Destroyers, like, floating around in some kind of weird blue lightning realm.
And they're riding horses.

JAY:
Where, where horses can ride outside.

MIKE:
So there's, yeah.
There's an oxygen atmosphere where I think the Emperor just, he want to an alternate dimension, and he pulled an...

RICH:
JJ Abrams thinks horses can run around in space.

MIKE:
I don't think it's gonna be that.

MACAULAY:
Space horses.

MIKE:
It's gonna be like Spaceballs when they're climbing the ladder to rescue the princess from a car.
Um, uh...
No.
Alternate, alternate dimension.
The Emperor figured out a way to open up a dimensional rift and hide, uh, 150 Star Destroyers in there.
And he says,
"Long have I waited."
So, you know, he's hanging out there.
He got, he has a new throne with spider legs on it.
And, uh, he's gonna, he's gonna come back.
And they found out where his dimensional rift is opened.

JAY:
It's in the, the ruins of the old Death Star.

RICH:
This all sounds so stupid.

MIKE:
That's the key.
That's the key.

MACAULAY:
I know.
It sounds so stupid, it could be true.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
How else to explain...

RICH:
It just sounds...
I don't even care whether or not it's true.
It probably, it's probably true.
But it just sounds stupid.

MIKE:
Well, how else do you explain how Star Destroyers float?
Unless they're in, like, the upper atmosphere of a planet, like, with lightning floating around, and they're hiding in a planet.
A gas giant?
Something like that?

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
Is she not running around on the wreckage of the Death Star?
I haven't...

MIKE:
No.
It's in, it's clearly on the outside of a Star Destroyer.

RICH:
Okay.

MIKE:
And you see multiple Star Destoyers floating around.
And it's in that blue lightning realm.

RICH:
I haven't seen anything since we did our predictions video.

MIKE:
Oh.
There's a new trailer.

RICH:
Uh, yeah.
I know.
I just don't care.

JAY:
There's been 13 trailers since then, right?

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
I, I watched the first one.
But, yeah.
Like, I haven't seen the other ones.

RICH:
Nobody wants to believe this, but I legitimately do not care.

JAY:
Not even in just, like, like, "I'm curious to see how they'll try and fix any of this"?

RICH:
No, no.
Not really.

MACAULAY:
Or even just to shit on it?
Like, just to shit on it?
Like, you're not even interested in that?

RICH:
Not really, no.
I'm just done with it.

MACAULAY:
Yeah?

MIKE:
Not in a schadenfreude kind of way?

RICH:
No.
I'm not.
I mean, I don't care.
I mean, I'll be...
You know what?
I want Star Wars fans to like it.
It's not even schadenfreude.
I hope, hope they like it.

MIKE:
Yeah, I might be...
I doubt...
I don't hope people dislike it.
I just hope, hope it's good.

RICH:
I don't wanna, I don't want millions of people to be miserable.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, exactly.

RICH:
I'm not, I'm not that big a jerk.
I want your Dybbux to work, or whatever...

JAY:
Dybbux box.

RICH:
Whatever, whatever that thing is.

JAY:
That would be pretty fucking amazing if Mac brought a Dybbux box.

MIKE:
It's a, it's an SB-7 spirit box.

JAY:
Dybbux.
Not dyvik.
Dybbux?

MIKE:
Dybbux.

JAY:
The Dybbux box.

JAY:
Dybbux.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's at the Zak Bagans Haunted Museum.

JAY:
I, I know.
I know.

MIKE:
I'm so excited to go back.
Um...

JAY:
Everyone, Post Malone's life.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Post Malone has a, has a hex on him.

MACAULAY:
You were talking about this last time, yeah.
It was killed, uh, Post Malone.

MIKE:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
So, you guys, I'm assuming you guys are gonna do a review of the new Star Wars.

JAY:
Oh, no.

MIKE:
Oh.

JAY:
We're not talking about that.

MIKE:
Probably not.

MACAULAY:
Okay, okay, okay.
Of course not.
Of course not.

JAY:
We're gonna go see it just because we want to hate it.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
No, I hope it's good.

JAY:
Yeah.
I hope it's interesting.
That's the thing.
Last Jedi, there's some people that legimately talk about it as if it's the worst movie ever made.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
It's, like, it's got a lot of problems, but it's interesting, at least.

MACAULAY:
I think, I think it's the worst Star Wars movie.
I really do.

JAY:
Ooh...

MACAULAY:
Like, uh, honestly, I'm, uh, yeah.

RICH:
No.

JAY:
No way.

RICH:
No.

JAY:
Not with the prequels around.

RICH:
Not with the prequels.

JAY:
Although that perception has changed a lot now.

RICH:
They're wrong.
Those movies are...
Those movies are absolute garbage.

JAY:
No.
There's people that think that, like, uh, the new trilogy makes the prequels look better by comparison, which...

RICH:
That's not true.

JAY:
I don't agree with.

RICH:
That's just not true.

MACAULAY:
It's also a lot of, like, those kids that, those, you know...

JAY:
Well, there were people that grew up with the prequels, and...

MACAULAY:
Yeah, when they, when it came out.
So now they're, now they're old enough to write articles and blogs.

JAY:
Yeah.
And if you like 'em, you like 'em.
That's fine.

MACAULAY:
It's just weird how many people, like, take personal offense to you not liking them.

MIKE:
They're, they're, they're, they're both bad in their own way.

JAY:
Sure.

MIKE:
The, the, the new trilogy...

JAY:
The new ones are good on a technical level.

MIKE:
They're good on a technical level.
They're exciting.
The action's well-done.
There's not so many flat shots with people in green screens, with, like, the Lucasfilm stuff, but...

JAY:
Boring political dialogue.

MIKE:
They're very well-executed, but it's just so, like, committee-ish...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
In terms of, like, the stories and, like,
"We gotta have this in there, and this in there.'

MACAULAY:
Yeah, it doesn't seem like there's...
It seems like there's a lot of cooks in that kitchen.
MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.
And it wasn't as apparent at first.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Like, you see The Phantom Menace, and you're like,
"Oh..."

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
But you see The Force Awakens, and it's like,
"Oh, this is exciting."
"And it feels like Star Wars."
And then it's only kind of as it goes on that it starts to, you start to see the bigger picture of what's happening.

RICH:
The, The Last Jedi may have mishandled the characters.
But unlike the prequels, I don't completely hate all of the characters.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Sure.

RICH:
I hate, I legitimately hate every character in the prequels.
Other than Palpatine.

MACAULAY:
Well, of course.
Of course.

RICH:
And he's the villain.

MIKE:
Yeah.
All the characters are so flat.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
And they have some really talented people.
Ewan MacGregor's a really good actor.

MIKE:
Sure.

MACAULAY:
And Natalie Portman, she's great.

JAY:
Oh, sure.

MIKE:
Everybody's good, yeah.

MACAULAY:
And it's, like, how many fucking...

RICH:
Ewan MacGregor's a great actor playing a wooden board...

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
For six hours...

MIKE:
And Sam, Sam Jackson.

RICH:
Or however long the trilogy is.

JAY:
Yeah.
All those movies, it's the writing and the direction that...

RICH:
Sameul Jackson is a fucking amazing actor playing a wooden board.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

RICH:
Natalie Portman is a great actress playing a wooden board.

MIKE:
Yep.
Yep.
Yeah.
So bad in their own way.

JAY:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
Uh, yeah.
Uh, here.
I need to pee.
We should take a break, anyway.
And we've only got about 15 minutes or so left.

MIKE:
All right.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
Cool.
Commercial break.
Boop-a-doop-a-doop.
All right.
We're back.

MIKE:
And we're back.

MACAULAY:
And we're back!
All right, all right.
I'm Zak Bagans, zoo crew.
So, uh...
So, Jay, I have a question for you.

JAY:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
What's your favorite Star Trek show, and why?

JAY:
Oh, the one with the whales.

MIKE:
That's a movie.

JAY:
It's my favorite episode of Star Track.

MACAULAY:
Um...
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a movie.

JAY:
I've seen, I've seen all the original crew movies.

MACAULAY:
Did you like 'em?

JAY:
Yeah.
I enjoyed 'em.
Well...
No, I did enjoy the fifth one.
I was gonna say not that one because it's terrible, but it's so terrible, it's fun.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.

JAY:
No, I, I like the movies.
I've just never watched much of the show.

RICH:
I, I can confirm that everyone else here likes the Star Track.

MIKE:
Mm.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Okay.

MIKE:
I do.
Yeah.

RICH:
What is it?
Why not, why not, Jay?

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
What's wrong, what's wrong, what's wrong with you, bro?

JAY:
I don't know.
It's just because there's so much of it.

RICH:
Yeah?

JAY:
Every time you guys talk about an episode of, like, TNG or something, I'm like,
"Oh, that's interesting."
"That sounds like a good idea for an episode."
It's not, like, uh, I'm like,
"Uh, fuck Star Trek."
I just haven't gotten around to watching it.

MACAULAY:
Is it, is it that the well is just really really deep?

JAY:
Yeah, exactly.

MACAULAY:
Is that it was is?
Yeah.

JAY:
It's a lot.
I mean, that's, there's so many TV shows like that...

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Where people are like,
"Oh, you haven't watched, you know, Breaking Bad?"
It's, like, it's eight seasons, or whatever.

RICH:
See now, with classic Trek, it's easy to get into, though, because it's all stand-alone episodes.

JAY:
It's episodic, yeah.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Which is different than TV now, where it's just one story across a season.

MACAULAY:
It's all serialized, yeah.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
One of these days.
I'll save it for my golden years.
I'll watch all of Star Trek.
Be 70-years old.

MACAULAY:
I'm thinking about breeding cats in my twilight years.
But, yeah.

JAY:
You can do both.

MACAULAY:
I can do both.
Yeah, I can do both...

JAY:
I'll watch Star Trek and breed cats.

MACAULAY:
And breed some cats.
Yeah, yeah.
Some purebreeds.
So, uh, um...
So, uh, everyone else.
What's your favorite episode?
What's your favorite series?
How about that?

RICH:
TNG...

MACAULAY:
TNG.

RICH:
Is, is the gold standard for me.

MIKE:
Yeah, I have to agree with that.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
I wholeheartedly agree.

MIKE:
I have a particular place in my heart for Star Trek: Voygar.

RICH:
Voyager?

MACAULAY:
I know.
Me, too.

RICH:
I find that interesting.

MACAULAY:
Me, too, actually.
Like, yeah.
That's, like, it's kind of schlocky, popcorn-y, kind of good.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
I, I can't watch Voyager without thinking about all of the things I might've done differently with the show.

MIKE:
The failed opportunity.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
I know, I know.
But...

MACAULAY:
It could have been more like The Original Series, if they're out on their own, and they're exploring.
And, like, it could be more of a survivalist kind of thing.
And also, like, strange new worlds.
Like, for real.

RICH:
Definitely should've been more of a survivalist kind of thing.

MACAULAY:
Yeah.
The Year of Hell thing that they abandoned.

RICH:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
You know, like, yeah.
That would've been awesome.

MIKE:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
If they actually did a whole season where just everything was falling apart.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Bigger arcs like that, um, but...

RICH:
It could've been an interesting show about whether or not they can hang onto their, their high-falutin Federation ideals...

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Without the entire support network of the actual Federation backing them.

MIKE:
There was...

RICH:
Like, do you, do you still go for peace and love when, when you're starving to death because your ship doesn't have the right power?

MACAULAY:
Exactly.

MIKE:
Many episodes dealing with that.
Many.

RICH:
Not enough.

MIKE:
Well...

RICH:
And, and...

MACAULAY:
They kind of did a little bit early on, and then they just got rid of it.
Now, it's Star Trek town.

RICH:
Here's the thing.
Whenever, whenever Voyager tried to pull that shit, like,
"Oh, we're running low on supply!"
That ship was so fucking beautiful, clean, and brightly-lit that you never fucking believed it.

MIKE:
That, that...
Yes.
Yes.
And, and a lot of that is production reasons.
Because there was an arc when they, uh, the ship got Borg technology on it.

MACAULAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Kind of early Seven of Nine episodes.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
So you have this outside of the ship, and it's got all these Borg parts on it, and defenses, and it can shoot Borg lasers.
And then it's like,
"Okay, this episode's almost over."
"Start tearing all that Borg stuff off."

MACAULAY:
"Hit that reset button real quick."

MIKE:
Because you have ten different stock shots of the ship going by, and they're not just gonna throw those in the garbage.
And, you know, they have to...

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
So there's things like that.
Um, but, that's why I like Year of Hell because it's a two...

RICH:
What is, what is Year of Hell for the 900,000 people who don't know what we're talking about?

MIKE:
Year of Hell is approximately one year in the Voyager timeline...

RICH:
It was one episode.

MIKE:
It was two parts.

MACAULAY:
It was a two-parter.

RICH:
Two-part, okay.
One story.

MIKE:
It's, it's the dad...

MACAULAY:
It was supposed to be a whole season.
That was originally what the pitch was.

RICH:
Yeah?

MACAULAY:
And they were gonna do it, and then they, they backed out.
And they just said it's a two-parter.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It would've been great.

RICH:
So what's, what's the, what's the deal?

MIKE:
The dad, the dad from That 70's Show, uh, what's his...

JAY:
Kurtwood Smith.

MACAULAY:
Kurtwood Smith.

MIKE:
Yeah, Kurtwood Smith...

JAY:
From Robocop.

MIKE:
From Robocop.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Uh, he played...
Have you not seen this?

RICH:
No, I have.
I just...
I wanna explain it, just for people who don't fucking know.

MIKE:
To the audience, yes.
He, he, he has this device that he can alter history throughout space.

MACAULAY:
And it doesn't affect the ship, so they still remember.

MIKE:
Yes.

MACAULAY:
They haven't changed at all.

MIKE:
The Voyager's protected, because they have, uh, some kind of shield thing.

MACAULAY:
Quantum something.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Phase...
Multi-phasic shielding that, uh...
No.
Uh, chron-, chronophasic shielding?

MACAULAY:
Sounds, sounds about right.

MIKE:
They have time shields.
I don't remember how.
So he, he goes and he does these calculations, and he resets the timeline.
Like, if this civilization died off, how would it affect everything else?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So it's, like, their...

RICH:
He's trying to resurrect his wife, wasn't he?

MIKE:
He's basically trying to find the timeline where his wife didn't die.
And he has a piece of her hair in this little triangular, uh, glass case.

MACAULAY:
Kind of like Mr. Freeze in, uh, in Batman?

MIKE:
Exactly.
Um, and so the Voyager encounters this, like, really pathetic ship at first.
And, and they're like,
"We're gonna fire a rocket at you!"
And Catherine Janeway was like,
"Ha ha ha ha!"
And then this timewave comes by, and then, and then it alters the present, and that ship becomes, like, a giant battleship.
She's all,
"Oh, shit!"

MACAULAY:
"Run!"

MIKE:
And so, the whole time...
And then they're the one equation in this guy's big time puzzle that, that doesn't change.
And he's like,
"Blow them up."
"Blow them up."

MACAULAY:
"It's, it's messing with my calculations."

MIKE:
Yes.
"They're fucking with my calculations because they, they're not changing in my time changes."
So he keeps just trying to blow them up for a year, and the whole ship's just wrecked...

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
By the end of the year.
Um, and then...
I don't wanna spoil it for everybody.
But basically, yeah.

MACAULAY:
They hit the reset button.

MIKE:
They hit the reset button.

MACAULAY:
It's time travel, so, you know...

RICH:
The point is, that should have been, that should have been first few seasons of the fucking show.

MACAULAY:
Exactly.
Exactly.
Like, yeah.
Because they were hanging on by a thread.
People are dying.
Like, yeah.
It's all those kind of things.

MIKE:
But, but that's paralleled in the, uh, uh, uh, the two-parter with the Nova class science ship.

MACAULAY:
Equinox?

MIKE:
Equinox.
Parts one and two.

MACAULAY:
Yep.

MIKE:
Good job.

MACAULAY:
Thank you.
I know, see...

MIKE:
Proud, proud.
Um, and...

MACAULAY:
I know my Trek, buddy.

MIKE:
Yes.
The Equinox is a tiny, tiny, little science vessel that also got thrown into the Delta Quadrant.
And, uh, there's a crew of, I dunno, 25 people.
It's a tiny ship.

MACAULAY:
Yeah, out of...
It started with, like 200.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MACAULAY:
And there's, like, they're down to 20.

MIKE:
They just had a miserable time because...

MACAULAY:
And they compromised their values.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
They compromised their values.
They find space eels that have superpowers in them that can shoot their, make their engines shoot the ships super fast.
And so they, they capture the space eels, and they're like,
"At first, we really didn't wanna do this."
"But then we were starving..."

MACAULAY:
"We wanna go home."

MIKE:
So Kathryn Janeway is judging 'em.
She's like,
"I would never do that."
"Well, if you're whole crew is fucking starving, you would."
Um, there is also a great episode where they get trapped in a, in, like, a, like, space bubble.

RICH:
I know which one you're talking about.

MIKE:
I love this episode.

RICH:
Where's the, their power is continually draining, and they don't have supplies.

MIKE:
They get sucked down a, like, yeah.

RICH:
And all of the ships that end up in this little bubble of space kind of, like, steal and pirate from each other, basically.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
They're trying to survive...

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
When they're, they're slowly losing power to this bubble.

MIKE:
Yes, yes.
And so, yeah.
They, they found the bubble...

MACAULAY:
It turns into, like, Mad Max.
Like, you know, in space.

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.
It's like Star Trek Mad Max.
Yes.

MIKE:
Everybody attacks them.
They steal their shit right off the bat.
And then, uh, Kathryn Janeway tries to form an alliance with other ships.

MACAULAY:
Well, which is kind of a neat idea.
It's like,
"Oh, she's trying to make her own Federation in this bubble."

MIKE:
But the, the interesting point was, they, they needed some components to make the ship fly out of this thing and escape.
And they got that one component from another race.

MACAULAY:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And they're like,
"How'd, how'd you get this component?"
And he's like,
"Well, I fucking killed the people and took it from 'em."
And she's like,
"Mm...I don't think we can use it."
"Take it back."
And everybody's like,
"Why?"

MACAULAY:
Bless you.

MIKE:
Some guy keeps sneezing.

JAY:
I'm allergic to Star Trek.

MIKE:
Um, but he compromised their values.
The Federation values of, uh, you know, taking equipment that was stolen, or somebody got murdered.
And so Kathryn Janeway was a very, very moral captain.

RICH:
That is my favorite Star Tr-, uh, Voyager, at least, story.
That one.

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
When they're in the bubble.

MIKE:
Yeah.
There's a lot of weird Voyager stories.

RICH:
Yeah.
