Mike Stoklasa

Part of the goal of Fair Enough Friday is to introduce the world to amateur moviemakers circling under the radar of independent cinema.
There are a lot of talented, dedicated, and passionate individuals out there making movies, and it's interesting to find out what makes them create.
The easiest way to do this?
Interviews.
 
Garrett Gilchrist writes:
Mike Stoklasa of GMP Pictures, along with his star performer Rich Evans, have been creating original comedy for over a decade.
Mike’s insanely creative editing, filled with jump cuts, slow motion, warped audio and perfect comic timing, has been much imitated by those who’ve seen his many movies, but never duplicated.
Although clearly comedies, the films of GMP rarely have jokes in them, making the audience laugh through sheer force of strangeness, and by constantly taking their expectations and subverting them.
Mike’s last major release was The Long Walk Home, a brutal spoof of amateur films.
Mike is very critical of all amateur films and filmmaking, keeping his own library of bad amateur movies, which he often spoofs in his own work.
In person Mike comes off as very funny and very depressed.
When he’s putting his heart into a project he can release more movies, and release them faster, than seemingly anyone else in the amateur movie world.
When he’s unsatisfied with a project, he does nothing and lets the world know … as with the famously unreleased Gorilla Interrupted.
He is currently trying to finish up shooting on the relatively expensive talking fruit epic, Oranges: Revenge of the Eggplant.

MIKE:
My apartment is cold.

JASON:
Mine too.
Mike, you and your production company, GMP Pictures, have been making movies for many years now, resulting in what's been estimated at over 100 original productions.
How do you manage such a prolific output?

MIKE:
You know...

JASON:
I do?

MIKE:
I ask myself that question.
How we made like 9 "features" and all those short movies, and I'm not sure.
I think the feature films are shitty, that helps.
And the shorts are not well put together either so that helps too.
GMP has sort of a midas touch of schlock comedy.

JASON:
So do you think quality has been compromised because you've put out so much?

MIKE:
Depends on the definition of quality.
Amateur movies and quality is a fine line.
I've seen millions of movies about a guy with a gun, often well-shot but with lame subject matter and horrible acting.
You just can't watch it.
but they may have spent a year making it.
In comparison something we slap together in a day may be funnier and more entertaining.
Our features take months, but they look like they took minutes so go figure.
Amateur cinema is a dangerous thing.

JASON:
Dangerous?
Why?

MIKE:
It's now in the hands of illiterate high school kids.
Powerful PCs with complex editing capabilities are now in the hands of total morons, and it's sinking us all down like the Titanic.

JASON:
Some would argue that the movies are getting better.

MIKE:
I guess it can be liberating to some, but others will get lazy and want to rush ahead to the "special edition dvd" of the movie shot in their moms back yard.
They're missing the point.
I'm someone whose first movies were shot in-camera with one take each.
I slowly worked up to a computer.
I don't know, just seems like people are stupid now.
Rushing things and making movies just to make them, not learning the important stuff.
There are people who make movies not to make a movie, but to make a box for a movie.
Like Guy McConnell.
Promotional stuff really pisses me off …

JASON:
Is that because you don't feel you're good at it yourself, or is there something more base in your hatred for it?

MIKE:
Because there's no point to have a trailer for a 5 minute film.
Or a website or a t-shirt, its just self indulgence.
It’s not hard to self promote things.
It’s just like movies are secondary.

JASON:
Part of the movie business is the business end of it.
Are you saying people at the amateur level should foresake this?

MIKE:
Yes, because there shouldn't be a "business" end to amateur movies.
Unless you’re really trying to sell the stuff legitimately.
Like when Random Foo sold me their compilation of films on the first Foo Base One tape.
It was a very slick website, all the movies had titles and their own posters, but the films were just terrible!
Like they thought the idea of these movies having titles and posters was cooler than the movies themselves.
I paid 12 dollars for the tape, totally insane.
There should be a certain level of quality achieved before one makes a theatrical release poster, website, and starts selling a film.
It should be something they have worked hard on and invested money and time into, as to not confuse the buyer.

JASON:
So effort comes into play with all of this.
In your mind, movies made with little or no effort should not be sold as a movie made by people working hard.

MIKE:
I guess.
It's not so much about effort as it is about this new fascination with DVDs and all this marketing.
It's like Rich said that all these people are just "playing film makers" especially all these new kids.
Like these kids that come out and have a poster for a movie thats not even written yet.
And they’re saying what will be on the special edition dvd when the movie is done.
I’ve seen this many times.
What's so special edition about their DVD?
They need to focus on making movies, and learning how to work with actors, and what match cuts are, and how to use different shots, and how to record sound, and expose a good picture, and turn off the auto focus, and to move the dog out of the room when they are shooting.
Adherence to the most basic rules.
Learn moviemaking first.
When you are at least competent, then go out and start selling.
You can rush a movie all you want...if you know what you're doing.
I wrote a feature script for Gorilla Interrupted in 5 hours and we shot the thing in less than 7 days.
Granted it didn't turn out the best, but it still had some funny moments, and we got it done.
We got shit done from experience.
This darn Internet has taken the patience out of people, that’s my only gripe.
No matter how many silly promotional things one makes, whether a movie is entertaining or not will always be the final determination.

JASON:
So it's not necessarily that people are making "bad" movies that's got you upset, but rather the fact that they seem to be focusing more on the marketing aspect of things and not trying to learn the craft.

MIKE:
I am made of walnuts.
Yes.
I love bad movies, I love good movies.
I hate mediocre movies where people seemed less concerned about making a movie than they did about telling people they made a movie.

JASON:
What is it that you love about making movies?

MIKE:
The magic of creation.
The magic of shooting a scene and then putting all the pieces together, to make it into something.
That’s why I love editing so much.
Taking what is sometimes junk and turning it into something.
That’s why I like the Oranges stuff so much, cause we're making a miniature world and characters out of our voices, styrofoam, fruit, duct tape, wood, plastic, paint ....things that are in our houses everyday, but we take them and mold them and give them life.
It's great fun to see that.
Then add in sound and music and editing, and you've created a world out of nothing but your own creativity.

JASON:
Have you made any movies that you would feel good about marketing and selling?

I think this new Oranges film will be sellable.
I like GMP’s more subversive and weird shorts.
They appeal to people on a strange level, but none of that is sellable cause it’s just home movies.

JASON:
So if you don't sell your movies, how do you get people to see them?

MIKE:
Who cares if people see them?
So they can say "good job, what’s next?"

JASON:
What would be so bad about that?
Why make movies if you don't want people to see them?

MIKE:
I show them to people around me.
Friends.
Family.
They matter.
I show ‘em in South Dakota.
Some screen name on the Internet doesn't matter to me.
We’re trying to make a quality film now we can sell.
I feel after all of my work I have finally learned enough to make something good.
EVERYTHING before was just practice.
And that’s one thing people don't get.
They fall in love with their own movies (and themselves) a little too much.
NO ONE wants to see you think you're funny acting like a hitman in your own basement.
All these movies are just junk.
Disposable junk.
Everything I've done, up until the point I sell something, is basically, when you boil it down, just junk.
The good you get from it is learning the craft a little more each time.
They are not movies you make websites for, and posters, and special edition dvds!
Not while millions of shot-on-film indie productions are struggling to make it out there.
It's all a waste of time.
To me amateur movies are really about learning for yourself and exploring your creativity.
They’re not paid-for entertainment for other people.

JASON:
So what's your advice to someone getting their start with a camcorder and an editing station: make movies, but show them only to friends and family?
Don't start a website and create marketing materials until you actually have something good to show?

MIKE:
It doesn't hurt I guess, but basically yes.
Devote your time into getting good at making movies.
Learn how to write a good script and so on.
Don't rush the film to get it out on the internet.
The internet is cool, but it can be a tempting siren of laziness.And if you feel your movies are bad and you're just copying other people, stop making movies and go out and play baseball.

JASON:
So you believe the internet is partly to blame with the mediocrity some associate with amateur movies?

MIKE:
Yes.
Yes it is.
The internet is hellspawn for movies ....
mainly just newbies though.
It’s good for people like Timberwolf that have Paypal and want to trick people into ordering their films with pictures of boobs.
Because stuff like that is tough to get into stores, the lower lower end of B grade softcore schlock.
But to the 15 year old who wants to copy-cat hollywood marketing with his film starring his little brother in a ninja costume...
it's a bad thing.
Cause the internet gives false hope to him.
Back when I'd make a movie like that, people would want to turn it off...so you try to make one better.
So your neighbors and relatives would like it.
You try harder and harder to get it good; figure out how to put music in, figure out how to do that early chroma key effect so at one point someone would say "wow.”
Rewind is a very bad thing cause we just say "good job" to these kids and their shit movies - Rewind is meant to be "supportive" of these kids, when they need to be told they suck so they try harder.
They can not be told "good job," cause then they rush into the DVDs, and they think they’re good cause they have a poster that looks just like the one at the local cineplex.
Amateur movies are about sucking.
It’s the very nature of it.
They aren't meant to be seen by human eyes, much less supported.
This is where the misconception comes from that I hate amateur movies.
I don't.
I cherish them.
I hate them being marketed or mistaken as Hollywood product.
Or mislabeled, misrepresented as what they are : Rough drafts of talent yet to blossom.

JASON:
So this odd clash that the amateur movie world is facing between independent cinema and amateur work - it shouldn't be happening?

MIKE:
Yes.
Queequeg Films is one of the few groups that has come the closet to actual marketable product, along with some other films, but 98% of the rest of it isn't marketable or useable in the Indie sense.

JASON:
Do you think having an annual festival that invites the public to view amateur pictures is obscuring what amateur cinema is really all about?

MIKE:
Yes I do.
People don't want to admit it, but an amateur film festival is a contradiction.
None of it is sellable to a distributor, and the public isn't too interested.

JASON:
Some disagree with you on that...

MIKE:
Mainly Rewinders filled the theater.
To some it is entertaining, but to most public they'd spend their time elsewhere.
I love Camp Rewind though, for personal reasons.
Meeting people, hanging out.
Rewind is now that metaphorical "friends and family" I spoke of since we all know each other.

JASON:
So showing movies to people at REwind is a good thing.
They can offer valuable feedback and help you move forward.

MIKE:
If they offer that helpful feedback, sure.
But people need to be meaner.

JASON:
They’re not being truly supportive by just saying "Yes...very good job."

MIKE:
Correct.
I just think that when making a movie, people need to try hard, or don't try at all.

JASON:
So, as you’re working on a movie now that you believe you will be able to sell, will that mean you'll be leaving REwind?

MIKE:
No.
Rewind isn't a house I live in.
There is no coming or going.
I will always support and be a part of Rewind.
Because my film probably won't sell.
But Rewind has at least taught me the difference.

JASON:
If you were to somehow get the attention of Dreamworks with Oranges 2, and they were to sign you to a picture deal that would bring you millions, what would you do to support amateur moviemaking?

MIKE:
I would buy Rewindvideo.com and place a picture of a horse on the main page.
I would do my best to stop amateur film making.
Too many people are doing it now that suck and don't have good ideas.

JASON:
But don't you need the bad to appreciate the good?

MIKE:
No, Confucius.
It’s like the Olympics.
Olympians are amateur athletes that compete – they are not professionals.
We as the public don't need to see the millions of people that tried out for the Olympics running, jumping, and swimming.
We just want to see the best of the bunch compete.
But the internet has given access to any schlup with a camera to post his filthy shitty movie for all to see, and be annoyed by.
Seeing failed wannabe Olympians suck isn't the point of the Olympics, ya dig?

JASON:
I do, but how can people get better if they don't mess up to begin with?
Failing upwards is necessary to evolving into a better artist.
REwind helps foster that, doesn't it?

MIKE:
No.

JASON:
Because it's too busy organizing the "crap" and patting people on the back?

MIKE:
Yes.
It’s not Rewind’s fault.
People need to figure this shit out for themselves.
People need to say "Gee, this sucks. This is inside jokes. Maybe we shouldn't release this.”
Instead it's a race for numbers on how many movies you made.
Random Foo has made 198 movies … a new one every second.
That makes them the big tops at Rewind.
It should be the opposite.
Rewind should condemn such activity.
Unless none of these people are actually serious about making it in the film industry.
Then they can do what they want.

JASON:
I think you're confusing Foo work with my work.
I was the one who made too many movies too quickly, and I probably created this image you find so annoying about them...

MIKE:
So be it.
You see my point though.

JASON:
Absolutely.
Very clear.

MIKE:
I think I'll just start making porno.

JASON:
You don't seem to have a problem at all naming names when it comes to backing your points.
Do you feel that sort of candor is frowned-upon at REwind?

MIKE:
Yes.
I will be hated.
I am hated.

JASON:
Does that bother you?

MIKE:
I shouldn't be hated.
This is my opinion.
We all can't be people that sit there and congratulate each other and don't have the nerve to speak up.
The people in Random Foo are nice people to talk to and so on, but I don't care for their stuff too much, though I did like Inquisition.

JASON:
I still cannot believe you liked Inquisition.
Jesus, Mike.
You must truly hate the movies I make.
Christ.
Sometimes you frighten me, Commander.

MIKE:
What?

JASON:
It's times like this that I honestly feel like giving up.

MIKE:
"Times like this?"
When you talk to me?

JASON:
No...when I think of all of the work I've done, much of it honest, real work that I tried hard to get right...then realize that something I think is shit outshines it in the eyes of people whose opinions I respect.
I wonder what the fuck the point is.
I wonder if I'm disillusioned.
I don't think I have the drive or will to continue with this shit for much longer.
I'm tired and sick.
After Bent 3, I will consider folding if I see no momentum.

MIKE:
No!
Make a feature!
With me and Rich in it!
It’ll inject new life and energy into your stuff.

JASON:
Gee, Mike.
Thanks.
That's a huge vote of confidence.
J...you suck on your own.
You need me and the mediocre talents of my oddly likeable chubby best-friend to heighten your banal movies.
Fuck.
Blech.

MIKE:
I need the banal serious slick stylings of Senor Santo to make my movies appear less like childish filth and more like quality material!

JASON:
It gets old sometimes, doesn't it?
Wanting to succeed at this?
I'm only 28 and I feel like an old man.

MIKE:
I'm 23 and I feel like an old man!
Yes.
It gets very old.
Especially when you're broke.

JASON:
I love the fact that a guy who I don't believe is all that great minus his editing skills is telling me what I need to do with my career.
That's very interesting.

MIKE:
Har...you wait and see sucker.
I'm a wise man.

JASON:
Heh.
Indeed, Commander.
There is some wiseness there.

MIKE:
You're foundering in your own fabricated self worth.

JASON:
Floundering, you mean?

MIKE:
Founder is when a ship sinks.
Flounder is when a person is drowning.

JASON:
Ahhh...

MIKE:
Founder - to fill and sink, to fall down or go lame; collapse.
Flounder - struggle awkward, proceed with difficulty.

JASON:
Mike, you need to have a vision, an idea, a notion, a plan to move ahead in this art.
I have it.
I'm good at it.
I know I am.
I believe in my abilities.
If that's foundering, then I don't mind because it keeps me working.
I do mind, however, when fucking parasites are calling themselves the real deal and others back them.
I get ill.
You know...I think I was happier when I was away from REwind.
I think I better disappear again.
I shouldn't be around again.
It's making me feel bad.

MIKE:
No!

JASON:
It makes me sick, Mike.
It really does.
No kidding.

MIKE:
You can't hide in a cave.

JASON:
I can just concentrate on making my movies and living my life away from them.

MIKE:
Me and Rich dream of the day when we will defeat the evil forces around us.

JASON:
Make a good movie and it might happen.

MIKE:
Never give up, never surrender.
Unless you make porno.

JASON:
What the shit?
