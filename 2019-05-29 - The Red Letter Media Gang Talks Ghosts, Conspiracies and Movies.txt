MAC:
Hey!
I'm Macaulay Culkin.
Remember me?
All right.
Obviously, you do, because it's my podcast.
So, um, yeah.
Uh, this week, we actually have amazing guests, plural.
Uh, it's the guy from, uh, Red Letter Media.
Um, so, for you guys that don't know Red Letter Media, they do this amazing, uh, um, uh, multi-part, uh, Star Wars review, uh, from their character, Plinkett.
Which they're actually longer than the movies themselves.
And I prefer them over the movies.
Uh, so if you don't know them, definitely go check it out.
Um, and, uh, also they have this, uh, show Half in the Bag where they do reviews of, of modern movies.
There's also a show called re:View.
Whatever.
I, I, I'm not, I'm not here to tell you their whole resume.
But, uh, we have a great time.
Uh, I hope you talking about ghosts.
Yeah!
Here we go!
"Now these happy days are yours and mine..."

RICH:
Sure, why not.

MAC:
Yeah, why not?
Why not start the podcast?
Get this, get this thing over with.
Am I right, jerks?

JAY:
That's what I'm all about.

MAC:
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, uh, um, we'll, we'll introduce everybody.
Um, across from me is Rich Evans.
Say "hello".

RICH:
Hello.
I am Rich Evans.

MAC:
Nice.
Well done.
Well done.
And to my right, you got Jay Bomber.

JAY:
Uh, hello.
I am Rich Evans.

MAC:

Nice.
Nice.

MIKE:
AJ Bauman.

JAY:
AJ Bauman.
AJ...Bomber?
Bauman?

MAC:
And then we have Mike...Stoklasa.

MIKE:
That is absolutely correct.

MAC:
Nice.
Nice.
So, Stoklasa, is that a family name?

MIKE:
It's my name.

MAC:
Oh, okay.

MIKE:
It's, it's, it's Czech.

MAC:
Yes.
Oh.
I was gonna guess Polish.

MIKE:
It means "drinker of beers".

MAC:
Does it really?

MIKE:
Yes, it does.
It means "crazed alcoholic".
No, it doesn't.
It means...

MAC:
Damn.

MIKE:
Like, a farmer, or...
Who cares?

JAY:
I always thought it was a stage name.

MAC:
Yeah.
Yeah.
That you picked.

JAY:
Yeah.

MAC:
Mike's...

RICH:
You thought it means "stage" in Czezch?

JAY:
That's...
Exactly.
I thought it was literally a stage name.

MAC:
Yeah.
It's actually Smith.
But that was taken.

MIKE:
I think it is kind of like a Smith.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
In, in Czechoslovokia.

JAY:
Mm.

MIKE:
A common name.

MAC:
Common name?
All right.
Nice.
Nice.
So, uh, um...
So, it's Red Letter Media, people.
Check this out.
I'm in Milwaukee right now.
I got, I got taken around yesterday.

JAY:
We had a, a grand tour of the entire city.

MAC:
Yes.

RICH:
I'm so sorry.

MIKE:
No.
It was, it was great fun.
We went to the Bobblehead Museum.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
They were very excited to have us there because they had it...
You've got it right up there.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Home Alone bobbleheads.

MAC:
Yeah.
You've got a Macaulay Culkin in your office now.
Yeah.
That's right.
Always looking over you guys.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
I asked permission if we could film there, and I said,
"I have, uh, Macaulay Culkin in the car downstairs."
And she said,
"What?"
"The fuck are you..."

MAC:
"Who?"

MIKE:
"Like, he wants to come up and..."

RICH:
"Get out of here, you fucking weirdo!"
Oh, god.
Can I swear?

MAC:
Of course you can.

RICH:
Oh, my god.

MIKE:
"He wants to point at all your bobbleheads."
"Macaulay Culkin."
And she, I think she thought I was crazy.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She's, like, she's hitting a button under a desk.

MAC:
I like, I like how they get so many crackpots, they actually have a button under their desk.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
They gotta be...
You can't be too cautious at the Bobblehead Museum.

MAC:
Yeah.
Exactly.
You never know.
Well, they said it's the only bobblehead museum in the world.
That's what they said.
I, I find that dubious.
There's gotta be another museum out there somewhere.

RICH:
I think that's the kind of thing you would just assume...
Anyone who makes a bobblehead museum would just assume it's the only one in the world.

MAC:
Yeah.
Exactly.

RICH:
Maybe there's only four.

JAY:
"Nobody else is gonna do this."

MAC:
"I'm the only one."
"I'm the only one crackpot enough to do it."

JAY:
Well, the weird thing is they had, like, the Hall of Fame Exclusive Bobbleheads, which I don't think is true.
Like, they had that logo on 'em, right?
That said, like...

MAC:
Yeah.

JAY:
"Exclusive to the Bobblehead Museum", or something?

MAC:
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's on the box.
It's not, it's not a sticker, either.
It's, it's on the box.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
They, they manufacture them, or, or connected to the manufacturer, or something.

MAC:
I bet you, yeah.
They have a relationship with bobblehead makers at this point.
It's just good business.
So, Mike.
You are, you believe in ghosts.

MIKE:
Oh, boy.

MAC:
Cut right to the chase.

MIKE:
Um...
I, I, I've had my position made very clear.
I, I'm, I'm a open-minded skeptic on the topic.

MAC:
Gotcha.
Yeah.
Because you like watching those shows.
The Ghost Hunters.

MIKE:
I, I love those from, uh, like, uh, almost a, like a guilty pleasure perspective where, you know, as an editor I watch them, and I know all the tricks.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And, and then I find some things fascinating, but I'm also like,
"Okay, how do I know that that wasn't faked?"

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
"Or how do I know that there, this person is telling the truth?"
So it's...
I find it fascinating, kind of like that.

RICH:
Spoiler.
They're not telling the truth.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Rich, I've watched a lot of programming.
I've seen lots of evidence.

MAC:
Yeah, no.
You should see Mike's face.
He went kind of like...

MIKE:
I, I've been to many haunted locations.
And I've had zero experiences of paranormal activity, so...

RICH:
We, we've actually done a ghost investigation.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Never, never seen.
Never aired.
We never did anything with it.

RICH:
Because everyone was too fucking drunk.

JAY:
Well, and we didn't accomplish anything.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
That's right.
We stayed in that haunted room.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
The Brumder Mansion near Milwaukee.

MIKE:
Yeah, which is...

RICH:
The Brumder Mansion.
We filmed, uh, an episode of Best of the Worst there.
And while, while we were there, we, we dug out the ghost hunting equipment.

MIKE:
That's right.
Yes.

MAC:
You guys don't have a spirit box, do you?

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
No.

MAC:
No.
I know.
Gotta, gotta get a spirit box for you guys.

MIKE:
That...
A spirit box, for those who don't know, cycles through radio signals...

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
And then when someone in a, in a van outside the production location hits a button, it makes magic voices appear for the ghost hunting crew.
"Get out!"
"Satan!"
"Oh, my god."
"Did it just say Satan?"
Some production assistant's typing in the words that it wants it to say.
So you never know.

MAC:
"So you never know."
"So, so I'm open-minded."

MIKE:
I'm open-minded.

MAC:
So, uh, what shows do you like?
Because I don't even know these shows at all.

MIKE:
Um, well...
I, I've been a fan of Ghost Adventures for a very long time now.
Um...

MAC:
That sounds like a cartoon from the 70's.

MIKE:
It, it's a very bad title.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That was the name of, uh, their first documentary where, where they captured...
Coincidentally, they captured their most amazing evidence ever...

MAC:
What?

MIKE:
In their very first documentary, which got them their TV show.
Uh, full-body apparation.
And, uh...

JAY:
"Evidence".

MIKE:
And, so, uh, like, a brick, a brick launched itself off the floor.
They had an actual scientist, or physicist come in and go,
"That's not, that's not attached to a string."
"I know, because I'm a scientist."
And they're like,
"Science man..."

JAY:
And you can't manipulate footage.

MIKE:
Uh, yes.

MAC:
Yes.
Was he wearing a lab coat?
That would be great.

MIKE:
Yeah, so.
It was like,
"Okay."
And they got their show on Travel Channel, and I watched it for...
Still watch it.
Um, although, the quality has dipped quite a bit in the last 16 seasons.
Um...

MAC:
It's like one of those, one of those shows has, like, 16 seasons, like, in, like, four years.

MIKE:
No.
I mean...

MAC:
Is it like The Voice?

MIKE:
That documentary was 2010.
2009, maybe.

MAC:
Okay.

MIKE:
Um, so they've been doing it for a very long time.

JAY:
The best thing about Ghost Adventures is the host.
It's that Zak Bagans.
He's a character.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
He's such a fraud.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
But they make it, like, hilariously so.
He's, like, this, this kind of jocky, dudebro-type guy.

MIKE:
They used to be more dudebro'ish early on.
They'd be like,
"Oh, dude!"
"Dude, look out!"
And then, like...

JAY:
And then now he's like a carnival barker.

MAC:
"Dude, this is cold over here!"

MIKE:
Now they're, like, they dress all in, like, black leather, and they look like a rock band.
And it's, it's taken on a different tone.

MAC:
They turned into, like, a bunch of Chris Angels.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

RICH:
That's, that's how I always felt about Art Bell.
A wonderfully-entertaining fraud.

JAY:
That's a skill.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Being that much of a blatant fraud.
That takes talent.

RICH:
I, I didn't care whether or not Art Bell believed.
It was highly entertaining.

MIKE:
Well, yeah.
Art, Art Bell was always, like, kind of the mediator.
He never really took a side, right?

RICH:
Ehh...
He had his...
You could...
He was presenting himself as a believer in conspiracies and whatnot.
But...

MIKE:
It...
Oh.
Like, like, I, I guess I'm thinking of George Noory moreso.
As sort of, like, you can't, he's just sort of like,
"I really don't believe you, but I'm gonna let you keep talking."

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Kind of thing?
Because all the crackpots call in, and they say the strangest things.
That's another, that's another paranormal'ish show that Rich and myself love.

MAC:
Which show is this?

MIKE:
Uh, it's called Coast to Coast AM.
It's on at midnight.

MAC:
Is it a radio show?

RICH:
A radio show, yeah.

MAC:
Oh, nice.

JAY:
Is it still on?

MIKE:
It's, it's been on for, like, 40...
Art Bell is dead.

RICH:
Art Bell is dead.

JAY:
He died.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.

RICH:
There's a new host who's extremely boring, and no longer listen.

MAC:
Wait, wait, wait.
He should...
Did he not come back as a ghost?

RICH:
He did not come back as a ghost.

JAY:
That's why people keep listening, in hopes that they'll hear him in the background.

MIKE:
That was, supposedly, Harry Houdini's final trick.

MAC:
Yes.
He had the secret word.

MIKE:
And, yeah.
He just, he just died.
He never came back.

MAC:
Oh.
Because he told his wife a secret word.
And it goes, you know, if you go to a seance or something, and they say,
"You're talking to your dead husband."

JAY:
Oh.

MAC:
I'm going to say...
I forget what it was.
You know, but it's been revealed now, but it's something, like, just, like, you know, like "bread basket" or something stupid like that.

RICH:
He, he went around the last part of his life just debunking...

MAC:
Yes.

RICH:
Phony mediums.

MAC:
Yeah.
Because he was perfectly qualified.

RICH:
Yeah.

MAC:
Because he was a magician.

RICH:
Yeah.
He knew all the goddamn tricks.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.
Yep.

MIKE:
From Milwaukee, too.

MAC:
He's from Milwaukee?

JAY:
Really?

MIKE:
Houdini.
Racine, or Kenosha.

JAY:
Oh.
I didn't know that.

MAC:
Hm.

JAY:
Wow.

RICH:
You know who's not from Milwaukee?
You!
You fraud!

MAC:
Oh, yeah.
Where you...

MIKE:
And also you.
And also Jay.

JAY:
None of us are from Milwaukee.

MAC:
Yeah.
None of us are from Milwaukee.
It's crazy.

RICH:
How the fuck did we end up in Milwaukee?

MAC:
How do we end up in...

JAY:
A lifetime of bad decisions.

MAC:
Life's a series of choices, and we all made some.

MIKE:
Jay, Jay went to school up here, and then we came up to visit him.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
And then they never left.

RICH:
I was, I was there.
I was there.

JAY:
Do you remember when that happened?

MAC:
"Do you remember?"
Uh, where are you from originally?

RICH:
Chicago suburbs.

MAC:
Oh.
You seem like a Chicago guy.

RICH:
Yeah.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Hungary.

MAC:
Yeah.
It seems like you'd be a crew member in a, in a John Hughes movie.
Like, yeah.

RICH:
Oh, no.
I was too poor to be in a John Hughes movie.

MAC:
No, no, no.
A crew member.
You totally look like a Chicago teamster.

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.

MAC:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JAY:
The characters in John Hughes movies are very specific.

RICH:
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

JAY:
Very specific, uh, upbringing.

RICH:
Rich white kids who have no idea they're rich.

MAC:
Yes, yes.
Whose parents are, like, really terrible actually.
Like, accidentally terrible, or just, just missing altogether.

JAY:
Yeah, that's a reoccuring theme in all of his movies.

MIKE:
I gotta share something real quick.

JAY:
Oh.
Mike's on the phone.

MIKE:
No.
I'm, I'm looking up Harry Houdini really quick.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
He was born in Budapest.
Um, and it says his family living on Appleton Street that is now called Houdini Square.
Uh, uh, on June 6th, 1882, became an American citizen.
Uh, father, um, moved the family to Milwaukee and fell into dire poverty.

RICH:
Whoops!

MIKE:
Just thought I'd share that real quick.

JAY:
Do we know where Zak Bagans is from?

MIKE:
Zak Bagans is from Illinois.

JAY:
Really?

MIKE:
A Chicago suburb, yes.

JAY:
Oh.
Okay.

MAC:
Just like you, Rich.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MAC:
You guys have so much in common.

JAY:
All the frauds come from Illinois.

MAC:
Yeah.

JAY:
The best thing about Zak Bagans is his voice.
Like, anything he says, it just instantly makes me laugh.
He has, like, this...
It's, it's just, like...
He has, tries to have this gravitas.
But he just sounds, like, I dunno, like he's completely full of it.
And it makes me laugh every time he opens his mouth.

MAC:
It's like a stage voice.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, there's pictures of him...
What's the, Zag Bagans Haunted Museum?

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JAY:
And there's all...
If you look at the promo pictures for it, he's wearing, like, a tophat, and doing, like, these theatrical, like, arm movements.

MAC:
Oh, my goodness.

JAY:
Yeah.

MAC:
Well, Mike.
You're wearing the sweatshirt.
The Zak Bagans museum sweatshirt in right today.

MIKE:
Yes, yes.
I've been there twice.
Jay, Jay's been there once.

JAY:
I was there, yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah.

JAY:
I was horribly hungover when we went, but it was fun.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It's neat.
It's a neat place.
Um, uh, there's lots of artifacts and, like, Ed Gein's cauldron is there.

JAY:
Yeah.
That's more the stuff I'm interested in.
Not the paranormal stuff.

MAC:
Yeah.
The true crime kind of thing.

JAY:
Yeah, yeah.

MIKE:
There's a serial, serial killer section, and, uh...

JAY:
Yeah.
John Wayne Gacy paintings.

MIKE:
Dr. Kevorkian's death van.

RICH:
There's, there's existing...
I thought they burned all of the John Wayne Gacy paintings.

JAY:
They had John Wayne Gacy paintings, right?

MAC:
No, no.
Like, Pogo the Clown, like, still exists.

MIKE:
The famous Pogo the Clown painting is there.

RICH:
Yeah.
But there was, like, one they executed, and their was, like, a big fucking bonfire.
And people were just burning his paintings.

MIKE:
Maybe he made a lot of paintings.

JAY:
He did do a lot of painting.

MAC:
Yeah.
He had, he had a lot of time on his hands in prison, yeah.

JAY:
John Wayne Gacy, also from Illinois.

MAC:
Look at that.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Oh, of course.

MAC:
All, all the crackpots from the midwest.
You know, yeah.

JAY:
I know they did a movie about John Wayne Gacy, starring, uh, Francis from Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.

MAC:
Really?

MIKE:
That's perfect.

MAC:
That seems pretty apt, yeah.

JAY:
I haven't seen it.
I'm sure it's terrible, but...

RICH:
Is that the Gacy vs Dahmer movie?

JAY:
No, no.
That's more recent.

RICH:
Okay.

JAY:
This was, like, in the early 2000's, where there wa all these direct-to-video serial killer movies.
Like, there was that.
There was a Ted Bundy movie.
Um, I think there was a, what is it, B.T.K. Killer?

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
I think there was one of those.
It's, like, this weird little trend of direct-to-video serial killer movies.

MAC:
Yeah.
Wait.
I just wanna go back.
There was a Dahmer vs. Gacy movie?

JAY:
Yeah.

MAC:
Like a b-movie?

JAY:
We have the DVD.
We haven't watched it.

MAC:
But it's like a b-movie, kind of like...

JAY:
Yeah.

MAC:
Yeah, yeah.

JAY:
I'm sure it's incredibly tasteful.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.
Yes, yes.
I'm sure.
I'm sure it's very...

JAY:
And treated the subject matter with the respect and seriousness it deserves.

MAC:
With the respect and the, to the victims, and everything.
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
Considering their mutual interests, they should've teamed up.

MAC:
Yeah.

JAY:
Maybe it's one of those things where they start out fighting, and then they...

MAC:
It turns into, like, a road trip movie or something.

JAY:
Yeah.
A buddy comedy.

MAC:
Yeah.
Buddy comedy.

MIKE:
"You kill 'em, I'll eat 'em."
That's the, that's the tagline.
They high-five each other.

JAY:
That's the, that's the trailer line right there.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
At the end of the trailer.

MAC:
Yeah.
You found it right away.
Well, well, Dahmer, there's another person from, uh, Milwaukee.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.

MAC:
Just a bunch of gems.

JAY:
There's something about the midwest.

MIKE:
Illinois and, uh, Wisconsin.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Because Ed Gein is from Wisconsin, too.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
So many serial killers.
And Rich.

MAC:
"And Rich."

RICH:
What?

MAC:
"What?"
"What I do?"

JAY:
I mean, that's literally true.
There are serial k-, serial killers in Wisconsin, and Rich.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
I don't know what the implications supposed to be, but...

RICH:
""Don't look in my basement."

MAC:
"Don't look in my basement."

RICH:
"Don't look in my basement."
"There's nothing in there."

MAC:
"Don't you hurt my dog!"
So, uh, uh, Rich, I, I hear you have a, uh, ghost story of some sort.

RICH:
No, I don't have a ghost story because ghosts don't exist.

JAY:
Is it an anti-ghost story?
I don't know this story.
Mike mentioned it the other day, and I didn't know what he was talking about.

MAC:
Yeah, yeah.
You were like,
"Save it for the podcast."
So...

RICH:
Uh, yeah.
Okay.
Well, here...

MIKE:
If you're comfortable telling it.

MAC:
Yeah.
Only if you're comfortable.

RICH:
Here's, herre's my not-a-ghost story, because ghosts don't exist.
Um, after my grandmother had passed, uh, I was, I was still living in her house, but, like, we're just, like, throwing stuff out constantly.
She was basically a hoarder.

MIKE:
Yeah.
We were burning all of her things.
We destroyed her piano.
Throwing all of her trash, her l-, life possessions, in the street.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
That would anger any ghost.

MAC:
Starting a dumpster fire with all their worldly possessions, yeah.

MIKE:
She was watching you from beyond the grave as you smashed her piano in a monkey costume.

MAC:
Is this, is this actually true?

MIKE:
This is true.

MAC:
You got into a monkey costume, and, and smashed your grandma's piano?

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
Now, this is this footage.
Okay, here's...
All right.
Now that's an entirely different story.
And now I gotta tell that one.
Oh, my god.
Um...

MAC:
You're stuck.

RICH:
When, when I was getting rid of all of this crap from my grandmother's house, I, I, I asked Mike to help me.
And Mike helped me take out my grandmother's old, uh, player piano by having me dress up in a monkey costume.
And then he just filmed me while I tried to get it out.

MIKE:
No.
Well, sort of.
Sort of.
It, it weighed, like, 700 lbs.
I mean, it was huge and big and heavy.
And it was like,
"Okay, do we lift it down the stairs, or do we break it into lots of little pieces?"
Because we were just gonna throw it out.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
So I was like,
"While we're breaking it, let's make a little short movie."
And Rich...

MAC:
"So get in this monkey suit, monkey!"

RICH:
You break that apart with a hammer in a monkey suit in this fucking 90-degree July weather, and I'm gonna film it.

MIKE:
There was no air, working air conditioning.

RICH:
"Oh, thanks!"
"Thanks for your help, Mike!"

MAC:
"Thanks for helping me move!"

RICH:
I remember we...
I remember we got, like, the heaviest part, like, the soundboard or whatever the fuck it is.
The second, the second that ended up out on the porch, Mike had to go.
The sec-, the second it was out the door, it was just on the porch, Mike's like,
"I gotta go!"
"Bye, I gotta go!"

MAC:
"I got my footage."

RICH:
"I got my footage of you in a monkey suit, tearing up a piano!"
 
MAC:
"Jackass!"

MIKE:
The best part of that little video...
I, I guess this is quite the sidetrack here, but, uh...
I was wearing a t-shirt, and I was just sweating.
And he's wearing clothes and a monkey costume.
At some point, you, like, snap.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And you just, like, start screaming at me.
I just kept filming you.

JAY:
Oh, yeah.
Aren't you, like, trying to get out of the costume, but it was, like, duct-taped or something in the back of it?
So you couldn't get out?

MIKE:
There was no zipper in the back, so we, I wrapped him with electrical tape.
And he almost died.
Those, those were good times.

RICH:
You fucking asshole.

MAC:
The salad days.

MIKE:
"I'm sweating my ass of in this monkey suit."

JAY:
"For your stupid monkey man project."
I remember that.

RICH:
So, I, I, I'm living in this house.

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
And, um, I, I was basically, I was just sleeping on the couch.
Because I, I was fine with that.
But I had recently, uh, started going out with my, my current fiancee.
And, uh, she was staying over that one night.
And it's, like, like, we don't wanna share a damn couch.
And, uh, there's my grandmother's old room.
It's still got the bed in it.

MIKE:
His grandmother's bed.

MAC:
Grandma's bed.

JAY:
Was that the, like...
Wasn't, like, gold or something in the bed?

MIKE:
Everything was gold in that house.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
That's a whole other story, Jay.
So, you and your girlfriend climb into your dead grandmother's bed.

RICH:
Yes.

MIKE:
Okay.
Keep going.

MAC:
"Keep going."
"Go on."

RICH:
We, we, we, we slept in that bed that night.
Not...
And, uh, uh, we both had dreams of my grandmother being angry and demonic.

MIKE:
Covered with blood.

RICH:
No.
She had black eyes.

MIKE:
Oh, okay.

JAY:
Ooh.

RICH:
I don't know, I don't know if she had black eyes in Karin's dream.

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
But she did in mine.
And you know what?
That was a coincidence.
Because my grandmother had recently died.
And we were in her bed.
And it was in our minds.

MIKE:
That's the question.

RICH:
And the answer is, it was a coincidence.

MIKE:
But similar dreams.
Angry grandma.

MAC:
Was it, was it scary?
Was it scary?

RICH:
Sure, it was scary.
It was a nightmare!

MAC:
Oh, okay.
Well, you said "dream".

MIKE:
Karin's was also a nightmare.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
Well, usually, I, I just, you know, when I said "demonic", I thought that was just implied.

MIKE:
Okay.
Okay.

RICH:
You don't usually, you don't usually have a pleasant dream about your demonic grandmother.

MAC:
Well, you never know.
She might have pie.

MIKE:
She might've just been, like, a little upset, in Karin's dream.
Like,
"What are you doing?"
In yours, is, she's the devil.
But...
I, I was always found that story interesting.

RICH:
Well, yeah.
But, I know...

MIKE:
It's, like, it's, like, it was both, on both of your minds.
And, and you both had the same dream.
Because you're kind of thinking this is kind of weird.

RICH:
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

MIKE:
Um, or from beyond, her spirit said,
"Get out of my bed."
In her own special way.

MAC:
Did you ever sleep in her bed again?

RICH:
No.

MAC:
Oh.

MIKE:
Why?
Why?
If it was just a coincidence, why would you not sleep in the bed again?

RICH:
For one, it was just weird.
Like, we did this for practical reasons.
She didn't wanna...
We didn't wanna both sleep on the damn, like, couch and be falling off.
It's like,
"Well, it's just here tonight."
"Let's sleep in the damn bed."

MIKE:
Okay.

MAC:
All right.
All right.

MIKE:
I won't press you anymore.

MAC:
So, so, uh, back to the monkey suit.
Have you ever done anything with the monkey man footage?

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

MAC:
Yeah?

MIKE:
We've made many monkey man films.

MAC:
Yes.

MIKE:
Uh...

MAC:
It's, like, an ongoing project?

MIKE:
Well, yeah.
I mean, it stopped.
It's ceased.

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Well, we filmed something with you in the monkey man costume, like, a year or two ago for an end of the Best of the Worst.
Remember that?

RICH:
I, I, I don't, I don't remember.

JAY:
We did, like, that, uh, 2001 parody?

MIKE:
2001, yeah.

JAY:
Where you're, like, beating the tapes with a bone?

RICH:
Okay.
Okay.

JAY:
Every once in a while.

MAC:
It's the same suit?
Same suit?

JAY:
Uh...

RICH:
I think it's only...
No, wait.

JAY:
No.

RICH:
I think at some point, we had to get a new one.

JAY:
I think the body is the same, but it's a different head or something.
I feel like some of it's still the original suit.

MIKE:
Yeah.
The, the first one we made was called Monkey Man Gets His, right?

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It had, it had your grandma in it.
Um, and, uh...

RICH:
Mike, Mike...

MAC:
She must've been so proud.

RICH:
For the record, Mike has a fascination with my family and childhood.
Like, an unhealthy fixation.
He would put my grandmother in, in our little high school movies whenever he could.

MIKE:
She, she was, she was so weird.
She was a very lovely lady.

MAC:
But she was weird.

MIKE:
She was super weird.
Um, but she had a, like, a funny voice, you know?

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
So I, I recorded her saying, like, all these, like, bizarre words.
And I would just kind of loop it in the background and, uh, do stuff like that.
But, yeah.

MAC:
Yeah.
So, it seems like you're always, like, been filming.
And, like, you keep, like, every stitch of everything.

MIKE:
That's true, yeah.

MAC:
Yeah?
You've got, like, closets of VHS's...

MIKE:
Yeah.

MAC:
Like, 8mm...
You got any snuff films?

MIKE:
Snuff films?

MAC:
Yeah.
Any of those?

MIKE:
No.

MAC:
Oh, okay.
Just checking.

JAY:
Not intentionally.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Not intentionally, no.

JAY:
That, that's paid off, though, holding onto weird, old artifacts.
Like the Dick the Birthday Boy picture.

MAC:
Yes.
Yes.
I've actually wanted to bring that up.
So, Dick the Birthday Boy.

RICH:
Yeah.

MAC:
Yeah.
Explain to me, uh, explain to me what happened.

MIKE:
Do you, do you remember that magical day?

RICH:
Do we need to explain the damn photo first?

MAC:
I think, I think we should for the audience.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just...

JAY:
Well, there's probably a lot of people that are familiar with the photo that don't know, that it has any connection to us or anything.

MAC:
Yeah.
Because it was on Ellen.

JAY:
That's, yeah.

MAC:
Yeah.

JAY:
It showed up on Ellen.
Like, it's just if you...
I don't even remember...
What is it you google?
Like...

MAC:
"Dick the Birthday Boy"?

JAY:
It shows up on, like, uh...
Oh, no.

MIKE:
Showbiz Pizza Bear.

JAY:
Showbiz Pizza Bear.
It sh-, it's, like, the first thing that shows up.
And it was on, like, uh, what is that, that subreddit for, like, cursed photos or something?

MIKE:
Cursed, Cursed Images.
And also Awkward Family Photos...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Used it in, not in one of their printing, printed cards...

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
But on their website.
I always check.

JAY:
So it's, it's taken on a life of its own.

MIKE:
Yes.

MAC:
So...

RICH:
When, when I was a kid...

MAC:
Yes.

RICH:
The, the, the standard operating procedure for birthdays for me and my siblings was to go to the local Showbiz Pizza.
And if you don't know what Showbiz Pizza is, it was basically the, uh, the precursor to Chuck E. Cheese.

MAC:
I was gonna say, it sounds like a Chuck E. Cheese-esque thing, yeah.

RICH:
And, and instead of a giant rat, they had a, a Billy Bob the Bear.

MIKE:
And he had a band.

JAY:
The Rock-afire Explosion.

RICH:
Yeah, Billy Bob the Bear and the Rock-afire Explosion band.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
But, but you know, there, there'd be a guy in a Billy Bob costume who'd walk around and interact with the children.
And so there is a Polaroid photo of me on my...
How old was I in that photo?
Like...

MIKE:
Probably five.

RICH:
Five.
Five to seven-years old.
Whatever.
At, at Showbiz Pizza on my birthday.
Photo of me and Billy Bob the Bear.
And I am wearing a t-shirt that says "Dick the Birthday Boy".

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
No comma.

MAC:
"No comma."

RICH:
For the record, I have never gotten a straight answer from any of my living relatives why they made me wear a shirt that says "Dick the Birthday Boy".
I have no fucking idea who thought that was a good idea.
If it was done deliberately or ignorantly, I don't know.

MIKE:
It, it...
Most likely, ignorantly.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
It's just,
"Oh, it's Dick the Birthday Boy."

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Not thinking to put...

RICH:
Right.

MIKE:
A comma in there.
That it's now, it's now a phrase or, or an action, action phrase.

RICH:
It's, it's, it's hypothetically possible that one of my uncles was just, like, snickering at everyone else behind their back.
"I got this shirt."
"Heh heh heh."

MIKE:
No.

RICH:
It's hypothetically possible.

MIKE:
I don't know.

JAY:
That's a pretty horrible thing to do maliciously to a five-year old.

MIKE:
Yeah.
That's, that, yeah.
But the, the actual Polaroid, when after your grandma died, and I was helping Rich clean all the garbage out of his house, you were throwing out photos.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, family photos in a garbage can.

RICH:
I'm not...
I am...

MIKE:
I saw that went in, and I helped you up...

MAC:
You heartless bastard.

RICH:
I am not a sentimental person.
And I was just kind of done with that phase of my life.

MIKE:
Sure, sure.
But I saw that, and a handful of others from that same birthday party, and a whole bunch of other Christmas photos, and you opening up, like Star Wars toys.
And I'm like,
"Rich, you can't throw all these out."
And I just took 'em.
And I kept 'em.

MAC:
Did you, did you tell, did you tell Rich that you did that, or did you just, like, just, did you just...

RICH:
I had no idea.

MIKE:
I don't remember.

RICH:
I was completely shocked.

MIKE:
No, I think I just stole it.

RICH:
20, 20, 20 years later when you sprung that on me, I was completely shocked.

MAC:
The, the long game.
Think about long game.

JAY:
What happened to those other Polaroids?
Because I remember you had them back when we shot that episode?

MIKE:
I have them somewhere.

JAY:
They're somewhere.

MIKE:
And I'm not sure.

JAY:
Oh.

MIKE:
But...

RICH:
Mike is holding my family photos hostage somewhere.

MAC:
Yes, I was gonna say.
Yeah.
He's gonna all of a sudden pull out another one.
But, yeah.
But the picture ended up on Ellen.
It ended up all over the place.

JAY:
Yeah.
Julia Roberts.

MAC:
Because I remember you had it on one of your shows.
And then I remember seeing the Ellen thing, and I'm like,
"I...that's fucking Rich Evans."

JAY:
I think at this point, it's, it's gotten large enough where people think the, that episode where we show the photo is a reference to the existing internet photo.

MAC:
And it's like,
"No, that came first."

JAY:
No, it didn't.
It was nowhere on the internet until that episode.
We have a high-RES scan of it somewhere, and that's...
I think all the ones that float around...

MAC:
A high-RES scan of a Polaroid.

JAY:
All the ones that are floating around the internet are just, like, a screengrab from that episode, I think.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
Well, we've got the actual Polaroid framed now.

JAY:
We've got it framed on the wall.

MIKE:
It's right over there.

MAC:
Oh, really?

MIKE:
It's in, in the hallway.

MAC:
Yeah.
I wanna see it.
I'm, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go check it out.
Yeah.

JAY:
Just don't take it.
We gotta put that thing in a safe.

MIKE:
We gotta insure it.

RICH:
Yes.
Yes.
Why don't you make, both make, uh, plans to what to do with my fucking personal items.

MAC:
Hey, you threw it, you threw it away, man.
That's what you get.

JAY:
Yeah.
Once it's in the trash, it's, it's, uh...

MAC:
It's fair game.

JAY:
Public domain.
Or, is that the deal?

MAC:
Mm-hmm.
Fair game.
So, you guys, uh, also do, like, features and things like that.
Space Cop, of course.
How many features have you made?
Like, for yourself.
All in-house kind of thing.

JAY:
Uh, well, I mean, we used to do, like, amateur movies and stuff.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
We did crap when we were in high school.

MIKE:
Yeah.

RICH:
I think "crap" is the appropriate word.

MAC:
It seems like you guys were always doing stuff.

JAY:
The first kind of, like, I guess, "real" feature would be the Oranges movie that you guys did?

RICH:
Yeah.

JAY:
Would you even consider that a real feature?

MIKE:
Ehh, not really.

RICH:
It's, like, proto-, it's a proto-real.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MAC:
If it's, if it's, like, 70 minutes or more, it's a feature.

RICH:
Oh, we've, we've been doing that since...

MIKE:
Oh, yeah.

RICH:
High school?

MIKE:
Yeah.
I mean, like, some, 60 minutes, like, some kind of horror movie.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MIKE:
But that's junk.

JAY:
Yeah.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
The Oranges...

JAY:
The ones where we tried to be more professional, or...

MIKE:
That, or The Recovered?

JAY:
Probably The Recovered, yeah.

MIKE:
Was after.
Because, like, Oranges, like, had some kind of distribution.
And then so did The Recovered.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And then after that, I think we did Feeding Frenzy.

JAY:
That was Feeding Frenzy, yeah.

MIKE:
And that, that was sort of, like, where we were just self-distributing our own movies.

MAC:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Like, when you deal with the...

MAC:
Got, got your posters made and everything.

MIKE:
Yeah.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Press DVD's and just sell them ourselves.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.
Out of the back of a van.
A, a creepy van.

MIKE:
A trunk.

RICH:
We sold them out of the back of a website.

MAC:
Yeah.
A creepy website.

JAY:
"You wanna order this movie, you gotta go to this, this filthy website."

MAC:
"Yeah, meet me in this alley."

MIKE:
"This nasty angelfire website."

RICH:
"Geocities."

MIKE:
"Oh, no."

RICH:
"Oh, yeah."
"Geocities."
"Gifs."

MIKE:
What'd you say?

RICH:
"Gifs."

MIKE:
Gifs.
"Dripping blood bar."

RICH:
"Buy our movie."

MIKE:
"Look at this blood bar."

RICH:
"Click on the link over the dripping blood bar and click on the..."

JAY:
"The website's a part of a web ring."

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

JAY:
Remember web rings?

MIKE:
Holy cow.

JAY:
Yeah.

RICH:
We're so old.

MAC:
Is that anything like an O-ring?
Uh, um...
You guys have been doing Half in the Bag since, like, 2010, 2011?

MIKE:
2011.

JAY:
2011, yeah.
I think.

MAC:
Yeah.
Something like eight years?

MIKE:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MAC:
How many episodes are you in right now?

MIKE:
170?

JAY:
It's 140-something.
I think.

MIKE:
Is it?

JAY:
I think so.

MIKE:
Okay.
I thought it was 168.

JAY:
Somewhere in that range.

MAC:
It's a really exact number, yeah.

JAY:
More than a hundred.
Less than two hundred.

MIKE:
I wanted to say, Jay, uh, we had a joke, like, eight years ago?
Seven years ago?
Where we had a season one of Half in the Bag.
And that was, like, ten episodes.
And then we said,
"Now it's time for season two."

MAC:
And it's been ever since?

MIKE:
And, and it's been ever since.
And I wanted to do, like,
"Now season two is just wrapping up."
And that was, like, 140 episodes long.
"Now we're starting season three."

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Just for no reason at all.

MAC:
Season one is just a 10-episode DVD.
And like,
"Oh, you gonna order, like, season two."
And it's a, it's a, it's a set.

JAY:
I think we called it, like, a season one because we were gonna take a couple weeks off.
Like, a month off from making episodes or something.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
So we're like,
"That'll be the break!"

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
And then when we come back, it'll be season two.

RICH:
Was that, was that when we were making, like, taking time off to make Feeding Frenzy?
Was that was going on, or...?

JAY:
No.

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Feeding Frenzy was before.

MIKE:
That was...

RICH:
Oh, that's right.

JAY:
Half in the Bag.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.
That was before Mr. Plinkett's Star Wars review.

JAY:
Well, it was shot before it.

MIKE:
Shot before it.

JAY:
But then we finished it after...

MIKE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

JAY:
Afterwards.

MIKE:
That was '09.

RICH:
Yeah.
I remember, I remember coming up to film Feeding Frenzy and talking with you about The Phantom Menace review.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Well, there is the, there is the Star Trek reviews before that.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Yeah, but...

MAC:
Do you guys have any lost episodes?
Like, something that you filmed and just never aired?
For one reason or another?

RICH:
There's a Best of the Worst episode, right?

MIKE:
Yeah.
There's a Best of the Worst shoot that was just, like, miserable.
Um, and we got nothing from it, so we canned it.

MAC:
What was...
Was this because you were just generally miserable, or was it, was it the material?

MIKE:
The movies were so bad.

RICH:
There was, there was both.
There was nothing, there was nothing to work with.
And now people are gonna clamor to see this episode, even though we didn't put it out there because it was the worst thing.

MIKE:
It's, it's locked up in the Disney vault.

JAY:
Yeah.

MAC:
So it was the worst of the Best of the Worst?

JAY:
Yes.

RICH:
Yes.

MAC:
Yeah.

JAY:
Well, that's when, too, when people say, like,
"I'd love to see just all the raw screening room footage."
It's like,
"No, half of it is us just sitting there just watching the movie."

MAC:
Yeah.
Just eight hours of that.

JAY:
This is why editing exists.

MAC:
Like, because we have a marathon today.
Because I did, I did it last time.
And, yeah.

JAY:
Yeah.

MAC:
I just remember it's, like, yeah.
Every since I got here, you guys were just like,
"Okay, be ready."

JAY:
Yeah.

MAC:
"Be ready for Wednesday."

JAY:
Yeah.
We prepare people...

MAC:
Yeah.

JAY:
"It's gonna be a long day."

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
"You'll probably be miserable."

MAC:
You gotta pace yourself.

JAY:
We want 'em to come back.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
It works, though, because after six hours of movies...

MAC:
You're loony.

MIKE:
You're a little slap-happy when it comes...

JAY:
When it gets to the discussion, yeah.

MIKE:
For the discussion, yeah.
So it's, like, yeah.
You don't wanna do it the next day.
You're fresh.
Fresh eye.

JAY:
The first few episodes, we did do it.
We watched the movies, and then we filmed the discussion the next day.

RICH:
We did.

JAY:
I think so.
Early on.

MIKE:
My, god.

JAY:
Just one or two episodes.

MAC:
Oh, is that why they were so terrible?

JAY:
Exactly.

RICH:
Yeah.
No, yes.
Yes.
That's a fact.

JAY:
Well, I think the first episode is only, like, 20-some minutes long.
Like, it's less than half an hour.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Which blows my mind.

MAC:
Because now...

JAY:
That we were able to do that.

MAC:
Yeah.
Because now they're upwards of, like, what, an hour-20 sometimes?

JAY:
There, yeah.

MAC:
It's about an hour.

JAY:
We try to keep 'em around an hour.

MAC:
Yeah.

JAY:
We, we trim it down as much as we can.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
But it always just, yeah.
You trim the discussion down to, like, I dunno, 45-50 minutes, and then you start dropping in clips, and it just keeps growing.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
It's a nightmare.
Every episode is a nightmare to edit.

MAC:
Yeah.
Because you have that eight hours of just raw footage of just recording of people.
And you've gotta find, like, the funniest 15 minutes.

JAY:
Yeah.
Yeah.

MAC:
Out of eight hours.

MIKE:
Yeah.
You, you watched the screening room footage.
Or, at least you used to.
And then kind of, like...

JAY:
Oh.
I used to go through it and make little markers...

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
Like, when something...
But I don't do that anymore.
That's just too daunting.

MAC:
Do you just take, like, mental notes now, or...

JAY:
Yeah.
I mean, you kind of remember most of the discussion and stuff.

MIKE:
You remember some of the really funny parts, yeah.

JAY:
Or, most of the screening footage, yeah.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.
Remember when everyone laughed kind of thing?

JAY:
Yeah.
I mean, that's easy to find when you scrub through the timeline.

MAC:
Yeah.

JAY:
"Oh, here's a moment where the, you know..."

MAC:
You can just look at the volume, like...

JAY:
Yeah.
I mean, you look at the .wav file.

MIKE:
You can see the .wav, .wav file, and, and you can tell where Rich's laugh is.

MAC:
That's when it peaks.

MIKE:
"Something funny happened here."

MAC:
That's when it's in the red.
Uh, you mentioned the Plinkett reviews earlier.
And, uh, I found out yesterday that Rich Evans, you were the original Plinkett, right?

RICH:
Yeah.

MAC:
Mm-hmm.
It was, uh...
What, it was the, it was the, the Olsen Twins.

RICH:
It was a...
Was it a...
It was a college project of yours, right?

MIKE:
Yes.
Yes.
That's right.

MAC:
So that was a long time ago.

MIKE:
So long ago.

RICH:
Yes, it was a really long time ago.

MIKE:
It was, like, a final video for, like, an, a filmmaking class of some kind.
And it was all these artistic, like, uh, lady on the beach walking, and I just turn in this garbage.

RICH:
What was the, what was the...

MIKE:
It was so much fun.

RICH:
What was the original concept?
I know we, we were digging around with, like, children's films.
Because we thought they were hysterical.

MIKE:
Yeah.
It was just to integrate you with multiple kids movies.
And we gotta couple, like the kid with the magic guitar.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
And, and...

RICH:

That was, that was, uh, Little Ghost.

JAY:
You remember the name of the movie?

RICH:
I remember the name of the movie.
It was Little Ghost.

MIKE:
And so there's one, there's one part where Rich is kind of, like, singing along, and then he makes the guitar fly and hit you right in the crotch.

RICH:
Well, the ghost makes, like, the guitar fly, like, to the other side of the room.
But we edited it so, like, the guitar flies into my face.

MIKE:
Yeah.
And it just keeps hitting you.
Um, but, but the majority of the stuff that was the funniest was Mr. Plinkett...

RICH:
Well, because...
Well, okay...

MIKE:
Reacting with the Olsen Twins.

RICH:
There's an Olsen Twins movie, and they are on the phones.
It was, like, The Olsen Twins Detective Agency.

MAC:
They're detectives, yeah.

RICH:
And they're on the phone talking to somebody called Mr. Plinkett.

MIKE:
No, no.
It was "Plinkus".

RICH:
Yeah, yeah.
I know it was "Plinkus", but we thought it was "Plinkett".
And that's why Mr. Plinkett is Mr. Plinkett.
And then, I, we just filmed, from the other end, we know, we took out Mr. Plinkus, then we replaced it with me.
And I was trying to be as bizarre as possible.
And that's, that's how it happened.

MAC:
You were crank-calling the Olsen Twins in their movie.

RICH:
Yes.

MAC:
Essentially.

RICH:
Yeah.

MIKE:
You were asking them for help.
They had a detective agency.

RICH:
"I can't, I can't find my pills."

MIKE:
Right, right.
And then, and then you trash your own kitchen for no reason.

JAY:
Now, something's wrong with the cabinet?
And you're, like, saying the cabinet's faulty, or something?

MIKE:
"My cabinet..."

RICH:
Well, I think it when I was just wheeling around with the wheelchair, I think just, like, the, the door...
I broke the cabinet.
The door started coming off of it.
It's like,
"Ehh, we'll just run with it."
"My cabinet's broke."

MAC:
Was it scripted, or were you just riffing?

MIKE:
Yeah.
It was just, yeah.

RICH:
I...
Probably just riffing.
